    "description":"The ROS1 S1986F mutation lies in the tyrosine kinase domain of the ROS1 protein. It has been detected in a patient with ROS1-fusion-positive lung cancer in concert with the S1986Y mutation. The two alterations at the same residue were associated with resistance to crizotinib but subsequent sensitivity to lorlatinib. In a murine B-cell line expression of individual S1986F- and S1986Y-mutated ROS1-fusion constructs were resistant to crizotinib and ceritinib but not lorlatinib, as assessed by cell viability and pathway activation assays (PMID: 27401242).",
