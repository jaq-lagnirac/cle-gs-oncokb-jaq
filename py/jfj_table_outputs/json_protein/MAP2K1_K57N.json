    "description":"The MEK1 K57N mutation is located in the kinase domain of the protein and occurs as a result of a mutation in exon 2 of the MAP2K1 gene. This mutation has been found in lung and intestinal cancer (PMID: 32641410).  Expression of the MEK1 K57N mutation in multiple different cell lines demonstrated that it is activating as measured by increased downstream pathway activation and cytokine-independent proliferation associated with mutant MEK1 compared to wildtype MEK1 (PMID: 18632602, 25351745, 26566875, 32641410). The activity of this mutant is regulated by RAF (PMID: 29483135). Cell line experiments further suggest that this mutation confers sensitivity to MEK inhibition with selumetinib and trametinib as measured by decreased downstream pathway activation and cell proliferation upon drug treatment (PMID: 18632602, 25351745, 32641410). A patient with Erdheim-Chester disease harboring a MEK1 K57N mutation had a sustained clinical response to treatment with the MEK inhibitor trametinib (PMID: 26566875).",
