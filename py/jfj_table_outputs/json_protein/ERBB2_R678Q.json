    "description":"The ERBB2 R678Q mutation is located in the juxtamembrane domain of the protein and is a hotspot residue. This mutation has been found in various cancers including biliary, breast, and lung, among others (PMID: 23220880, 30449325). There is conflicting functional data for this mutation. Expression of this mutation in breast, bladder cancer and murine fibroblast cell lines demonstrated that it is activating as measured by increased protein and pathway activation, growth-factor independent cell proliferation, and colony formation compared to wildtype (PMID: 24971884, 30449325). However, expression of this mutation in breast and murine fibroblast and B-cell cell lines demonstrate that it is neutral as measured by no change in protein activity, cell proliferation or colony formation compared to wildtype (PMID: 23220880, 29967253). In vitro studies have demonstrated that this mutation is sensitive to the ERBB2 inhibitors trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatinib, afatinib, sapitinib, osimertinib and neratinib when expressed in a murine fibroblast cell line as measured by moderately decreased cell proliferation upon drug treatment (PMID: 23220880, 29967253, 30449325). Two patients with colorectal and gastroesophageal cancer harboring this mutation had progressive disease upon treatment with neratinib, and a patient with endometrial cancer harboring this mutation had stable disease (5.5 months) upon treatment with neratinib in a neratinib basket trial (PMID: 29420467).",

      "description":"Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are both monoclonal antibodies against ERBB2/HER2 and docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent that acts by disrupting the microtubular network in cells that is essential for mitotic and interphase cellular functions. The triple combination of these therapeutic agents is FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have not received prior anti-HER2 therapy or chemotherapy for metastatic disease. In a multicenter, nonrandomized phase II study (FCT 1703-R2D2, NCT03845270) of trastuzumab, pertuzumab and docetaxel in 45 patients with ERBB2-mutated, advanced non-small cell lung cancer who progressed after at least one platinum-based treatment, the objective response rate was 29% (n = 13/45) in which 58% of patients had stable disease (n = 26/45) and the median progression-free survival was 6.8 months (95% CI=4.0 to 8.5) (PMID: 35073148). Preclinical studies in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines and HER2-positive breast and non\u2013small cell lung cancer xenograft models have shown that combining trastuzumab and pertuzumab resulted in greater antitumor activity compared to treatment with either antibody alone due to more comprehensive signaling blockade provided by the antibodies binding to different HER2 epitopes (PMID: 15059883, 19934333). In a separate preclinical study, treatment of a HER2-positive mouse xenograft model of breast cancer with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and docetaxel resulted in enhanced apoptosis, infiltration of mononuclear cells, a strong reduction in the phosphorylation of HER2, EGFR, HER3, ERK, and AKT, as well as a slower tumor growth rate compared to controls (PMID: 28959366).",
