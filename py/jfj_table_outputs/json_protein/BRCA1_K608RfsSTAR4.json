    "description":"Truncating mutations in BRCA1 can lead to varying C-terminally truncated proteins that results in aberrant protein folding, contributing to loss of BRCA1 protein function. Human breast cancer cell lines that contain a truncating mutation in BRCA1 display elevated levels of aneuploidy and impaired DNA damage response. In addition, truncating mutations have been shown to induce aberrant protein localization, which may impact the interaction of important binding partners (PMID: 20608970). Mouse models of BRCA1 truncating mutations develop cancer, including mammary carcinomas, lymphomas and ovarian carcinomas (PMID: 11358863, 12483515, 12947386).",

This drug is considered standard-of-care for the treatment of patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. Initial FDA approval was based on Phase I and Phase II clinical trials evaluating patients with ovarian cancer harboring known BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations, in which treatment with olaparib demonstrated a clear clinical benefit. Specifically, in a Phase II trial evaluating olaparib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and a confirmed germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (n=193), the tumor response rate was 31% (95% CI=24.6 to 38.1), and stable disease (around 8 weeks) was seen in 40% of patients (95% CI=33.4 to 47.7) (PMID: 25366685).

In the seven-year follow-up of the Phase III SOLO1/GOG-3004 trial of maintenance olaparib versus placebo in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer harboring a BRCA mutation, the seven-year median overall survival rates were 67% in the olaparib arm and 46.5% in the placebo arm, and the median duration of treatment was 24.6 months with olaparib and 13.9 months with placebo (PMID: 36082969).",

        "Olaparib is FDA-approved as monotherapy in patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutated (as detected by an FDA-approved test) advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with three or more prior lines of chemotherapy"
      ],
      "description":"Olaparib, a small molecule PARP inhibitor, is FDA-approved with or without bevacizumab for the treatment of patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have deleterious germline BRCA mutations and have been treated with three or more lines of chemotherapy, or as maintenance therapy for patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are having partial or complete responses to platinum-based chemotherapy. This drug is considered standard-of-care for the treatment of patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. Initial FDA approval was based on Phase I and Phase II clinical trials evaluating patients with ovarian cancer harboring known BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations, in which treatment with olaparib demonstrated a clear clinical benefit. Specifically, in a Phase II trial evaluating olaparib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and a confirmed germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (n=193), the tumor response rate was 31% (95% CI=24.6 to 38.1), and stable disease (around 8 weeks) was seen in 40% of patients (95% CI=33.4 to 47.7) (PMID: 25366685). More recent FDA approval was based on a planned retrospective analysis of Phase II trial data in which patients with deleterious BRCA mutations had significantly longer progression-free survival with olaparib maintenance therapy than patients given placebo (11.2 months vs 4.3 months; HR=0.18; p<0\u00b70001)(PMID: 24882434). In the seven-year follow-up of the Phase III SOLO1/GOG-3004 trial of maintenance olaparib versus placebo in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer harboring a BRCA mutation, the seven-year median overall survival rates were 67% in the olaparib arm and 46.5% in the placebo arm, and the median duration of treatment was 24.6 months with olaparib and 13.9 months with placebo (PMID: 36082969).",
