    "description":"The class I (PMID: 28783719) activating exon 15 BRAF V600K missense mutation is located in the kinase domain of the BRAF protein. BRAF V600 alterations (predominantly V600E) are recurrent in lung (PMID: 25079552, 23833300) and thyroid (PMID: 25417114) cancers, among others. In metastatic melanoma, frequency of V600K mutation is second only to V600E, the most common BRAF alteration (PMID: 26091043). Analysis of clinicopathologic features and outcome in patients with metastatic melanoma harboring activating BRAF mutations revealed that, compared to V600E, V600K mutation was significantly associated with male sex, older age (median age, head/neck primary tumor location, shorter interval to stage IV disease, and shorter overall survival from the time of diagnosis of stage IV disease (PMID: 23922205, 22535154). Comprehensive biological characterization of BRAF V600K mutation (PMID: 15035987, 26343582) has demonstrated that this mutation activates the downstream MAPK pathway independently of RAS (PMID: 19251651, 26343582), renders BRAF constitutively activated in monomeric form (PMID: 20179705) and retains sensitivity to RAF monomer inhibitors such as vemurafenib (PMID: 26343582, 28783719, 20179705). Preliminary studies suggest that BRAF V600K mutant tumors may not respond to combined BRAF and MEK inhibition as well as BRAF V600E tumors due to a decreased reliance on the MAPK pathway, though further studies are needed to validate this finding (PMID: 30630828).",

FDA approval of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib was based on results from an open-label Phase III study of combination therapy versus dabrafenib monotherapy in 247 patients with metastatic melanoma who were naive to treatment with BRAF inhibitors. Combined dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, improved the response rate in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma versus dabrafenib monotherapy (67% vs.51%; p<0.002). However, median progression-free survival improved by only 2 weeks (9.3 months vs 8.8 months; HR = 0.75) compared with dabrafenib monotherapy (PMID: 23020132). Combination therapy is associated with less cutaneous toxicity than monotherapy, but systemic toxicity may be increased (PMID: 25287827, 25399551). Follow-up trials have demonstrated that all clinical measures inclusive of overall and median progression-free survival as well as objective response rates, median duration of response and number of patients with complete response favored patients treated with combination dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, compared to either dabrafenib or vemurafenib monotherapy, including patients who previously progressed on BRAF inhibitor monotherapy (PMID: 25287827, 25399551, 25265492). Additionally, patients with melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings have improved survival over patients given standard of care (PMID: 29361468, 28991513, 28891408). Promising clinical data has also suggested that addition of an immunotherapy agent to combination RAF and MEK inhibitor treatment may improve rate of overall response and duration of response in melanoma patients (PMID: 31171876, 31171879, 31171878).",

In an open-label, randomized Phase III trial, patients with BRAF V600E/K-mutated unresectable, metastatic melanoma received oral trametinib (2 mg once daily) or an intravenous regimen of either dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2) or paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) every three weeks.

However, like other MEK inhibitors, the benefit of trametinib is limited by adverse reactions, most notably grade three or four rash and diarrhea (PMID: 22663011). Trametinib is not typically used as monotherapy for patients with BRAF V600K melanoma given its lower response rate compared to BRAF inhibitors and combined BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Patients previously treated with a RAF inhibitor appear to be less likely than untreated patients to respond to trametinib treatment (PMID: 22663011), and FDA guidelines state that trametinib as a monotherapy is not indicated for these patients. Dabrafenib and trametinib are FDA-approved as a combination therapy, which has superior clinical outcomes compared to dabrafenib or trametinib monotherapy (PMID: 25399551, 25265492).
