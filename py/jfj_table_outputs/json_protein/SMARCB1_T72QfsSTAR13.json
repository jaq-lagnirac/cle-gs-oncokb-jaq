    "description":"Truncating mutations in SMARCB1 are often found in malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs), lead to loss exons 4 and 5 of the gene and subsequent loss of protein function (PMID: 9671307). Loss of SMARCB1 in MRTs can lead to activation of the Hedgehog pathway via aberrant activation of GLI1, a direct protein interactor of SMARCB1 (PMID:21076395). SMARCB1 loss was also shown to activate the downstream Wnt/Beta-catenin pathway and is important in hepatocyte differentiation. (PMID:23435428,). SMARCB1-mutant MRT xenografts in mice have also been shown to be sensitive to EZH2 inhibition, suggesting that these tumors may be dependent on EZH2 enzymatic activity (PMID:23620515). Reintroduction of SMARCB1 protein in SMARCB1-deleted MRT cell lines resulted in growth arrest through histone-deacetylase(HDAC)-dependent down-regulation of cyclin-D1, demonstrating another mechanism by which this tumor suppressor functions (PMID:12138206, 30755442).",

      "description":"Tazemetostat is a small molecule inhibitor of the methyltransferase EZH2. Phase I clinical trials of tazemetostat in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, advanced solid tumors and relapsed or refractory SMARCB1-negative tumors showed durable responses, including complete responses, in eight (38%) of 21 patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, two (5%) of 43 patients with solid tumors and four (9%) of 46 patients with SMARCB1-negative tumors (Abstract: Chi et al. Abstract# A175, AACR-NCI-EORTC 2017. http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/4557/presentation/616)( PMID: 29650362). Cell line and xenograft studies demonstrate that SMARCB1-depleted tumors, including SMARCB1-null malignant rhabdoid tumors and SS18-SSX fusion-positive synovial sarcomas, are sensitive to tazemetostat treatment as shown by inhibition of proliferation and increased differentiation (PMID: 23620515, 20951942, 27391784).",
