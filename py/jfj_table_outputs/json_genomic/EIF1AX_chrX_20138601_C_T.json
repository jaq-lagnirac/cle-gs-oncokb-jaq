This mutation has been identified in ovarian cancer and is a statistically significant hotspot (PMID: 32901952). In vivo studies with yeast expressing EIF1AX R13P demonstrate that the mutation is inactivating as measured by decreased steady-state protein expression and recognition of the initiation site compared to wildtype (PMID: 29206102).",
