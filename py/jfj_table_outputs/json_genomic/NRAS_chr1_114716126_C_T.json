    "description":"The NRAS G12D mutation is located in the GTP binding domain of the protein. This mutation has been found in leukemia and melanoma and is a statistically significant hotspot (PMID: 21586752, 27664710, 26619011). Expression of this mutation in the myeloid progenitor cells demonstrated that it is activating as measured by increased pathway activation, increased cell proliferation and leukemogenesis when expressed in mouse models compared to wildtype (PMID: 21586752, 23687087). Expression of NRAS G12D in the colon epithelium of engineered mice did not show a proliferation advantage but conferred resistance to apoptosis (PMID: 18372904). However, expression of this mutation in a knock-in melanoma mouse model suggested that it may be neutral in this context as demonstrated by no increase in tumorigenicity compared to wildtype and the NRAS Q61R allele (PMID: 25252692). Structural analysis of the G12 residue demonstrates that it is crucial for NRAS GTP hydrolyzing activity suggesting that any mutation at G12 would render the protein constitutively active (PMID:9219684). In a basket trial of refractory solid tumors treated with a single-agent MEK inhibitor, binimetinib, sixteen patients with codon 12/13 NRAS-mutated colorectal cancer (n = 8 patients with G12D) had a poorer OS and PFS compared to eight patients with colorectal cancer harboring a mutation in codon 61 (PMID: 33637626).",

Abstract #9519, ASCO 2017. http://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2017.35.15_suppl.9519).

Mouse allograft studies of melanoma harboring the NRAS Q61K mutation demonstrated synergistically decreased cell proliferation and tumor shrinkage in response to combined MEK1/2 and CDK4/6 inhibition compared to inhibition of either target alone (PMID: 22983396). In vitro studies have shown that resistance to combined MEK1/2 and CDK4/6 inhibition may occur through the reactivation of RAS and/or PI3K signaling (PMID: 30819666).",
