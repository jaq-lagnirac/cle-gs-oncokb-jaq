    "description":"Truncating mutations in SDHD can occur anywhere throughout the gene and are predicted to lead to loss of its protein product. SDHD encodes a subunit of the Succinate Dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, an enzyme that is part of the Krebs cycle and complex II of the respiratory chain (PMID: 20226277). Loss of SDH complex has been shown to lead to succinate accumulation, which behaves as an oncometabolite to induce tumor formation through multiple mechanisms (PMID: 31039394). Reduced expression of SDHD has been reported in colorectal and gastric cancer (PMID: 12883710). Germline mutations in SDHD, including truncating variants, have been associated with the development of paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas (PMID: 28099933, 12111639, 29545045).",
