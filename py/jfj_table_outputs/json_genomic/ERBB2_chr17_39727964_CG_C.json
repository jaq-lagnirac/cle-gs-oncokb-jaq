    "description":"The ERBB2 A1232fs mutation is located in the extracellular domain of the protein. This mutation has been found in colorectal cancer (PMID: 25344691, 27149842). There is conflicting functional data for this mutation. Expression of this mutation in a murine fibroblast cell line demonstrated that it may be activating as measured by increased cell proliferation compared to wildtype (PMID: 29967253). However, expression in a murine B-cell line demonstrated that it is neutral as measured by no change in proliferation compared to wildtype (PMID: 29967253). In vitro studies of this mutation demonstrate that it is resistant to the ERBB2 inhibitor trastuzumab, but sensitive to lapatinib, sapitinib, afatinib, neratinib, and osimertinib when expressed in a murine B-cell line as measured by decreased cell proliferation upon drug treatment (PMID: 29967253).",
