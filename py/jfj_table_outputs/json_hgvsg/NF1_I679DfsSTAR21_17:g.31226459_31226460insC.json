In vitro studies have demonstrated that these mutations are likely inactivating as measured by reduced NF1 protein expression, decreased GAP activity, increased GTP-bound RAS, and enhanced downstream signaling compared to wildtype (PMID: 19573811, 24576830, 8563751, 7542586, 8052307, 12509763).

FDA approval was based on the results of the open-label, multicenter, single-arm Phase II SPRINT Stratum I trial of selumetinib in 50 pediatric patients with NF1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas in which 37 patients had a partial response (74%; 95% CI= 60 - 85) and the overall response rate was 66% (n=33; 95% CI= 51-79) (PMID: 32187457). In a prior phase I trial of selumetinib in children with NF1 who had inoperable PN, seventeen of 24 (71%) children had a partial response (PMID: 28029918). In vivo studies in a mouse model of NF1 demonstrated tumor regression in twelve of eighteen mice (67%) upon treatment with selumetinib (PMID: 28029918).",
