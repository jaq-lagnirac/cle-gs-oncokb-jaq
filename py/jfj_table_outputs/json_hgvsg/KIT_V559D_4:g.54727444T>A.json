Biological characterization of Ba/F3 and 293T cell lines expressing this variant demonstrated that this mutation is activating and promotes cell growth, as evidenced by pathway activation and tumor growth in vivo (PMID: 9438854, 15790786, 17699867). Cells transformed with KIT V559D alone or in combination with KIT D820Y are sensitive to imatinib, dasatinib, sorafenib and nilotinib in vitro as measured by cell growth and apoptosis (PMID: 17372901, 17699867).",

FDA approval was based on the Phase II trial of imatinib in 147 patients with malignant or unresectable GIST in which 56 patients across two dose levels had a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 38% (95% CI= 30-46) (PMID: 12181401). Two further Phase III studies of imatinib in 946 or 694 patients, respectively, with KIT-expressing malignant or unresectable GIST demonstrated a greater response rate in patients given 800mg imatinib versus 400mg, with complete response rates ranging from 44.6%-48.1% at the 800 mg dose versus 5.2%-5.3% at the 400mg dose (PMID: 18235122, 18955451). Long-term follow-up of these patients demonstrated a ten-year overall survival across both study arms of 22% (95% CI= 19.0-26.0), with patients harboring KIT exon 9 mutations having significantly shorter overall survival on imatinib than patients with KIT exon 11 mutations (p=0.0013) (PMID: 28196207).",
