These alterations affect the ability of TSC1 to act as a molecular scaffold for TSC2 and TBC1D7 in the formation of the TSC complex. This disrupts the function and/or subcellular localization of the complex and prevents it from inhibiting the mTOR pathway via interactions with RHEB (PMID: 23485365, 20301399), leading to constitutive mTOR pathway activation and an oncogenic phenotype (PMID: 24529379).",

FDA approval is based on the results of a Phase III clinical trial of everolimus in patients with SEGA associated with TSC in which 35% of patients receiving everolimus (27 of 78 patients) experienced a reduction of at least 50% in the total volume of all targetable SEGAs versus no patients in the placebo group (PMID: 23158522). Patients in the everolimus group responded to the drug irrespective of whether they had a TSC1 or TSC2 mutation, although a higher percentage of patients with TSC1 mutations responded (five of ten patients, 50%) compared to those with TSC2 mutations (sixteen of 55 patients, 29%) (PMID: 23158522).",
