    "description":"The IDH2 R172K mutation is located in the catalytic site of the IDH2 protein. This mutation has been found in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, among others (PMID: 20567020, 33017591). In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that this mutation changes IDH2 enzymatic activity, allowing for the conversion of \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG) to the \"oncometabolite\" D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) and leads to oncogenicity, as demonstrated by increased liver 2-HG levels, blocked differentiation, expanded liver progenitor cells and development of premalignant biliary lesions compared to wildtype (PMID: 20171147, 25043045).  In vitro and ex vivo studies have shown that the IDH2 R172K mutation is sensitive to inhibition by enasidenib, a selective inhibitor of mutant IDH2 enzymes, as measured by reduced intracellular levels of 2-HG and increased cellular differentiation compared to untreated cells (PMID: 28193778). A Phase 1/2 clinical trial of enasidenib in 34 patients with refractory AML who carry the IDH2 R172K mutation further demonstrated this mutation's sensitivity to enasidenib as measured by reduced plasma 2-HG levels in peripheral blood after one cycle of treatment with 100-mg daily doses of enasidenib (PMID: 28588020).",

FDA approval was based on results from the Phase I/II study of enasidenib in 239 patients with mutant-IDH2 advanced myeloid malignancies in which the overall response rate (ORR) of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to enasidenib treatment was 40.3% and the overall survival of patients with refractory disease or those with complete remissions after enasidenib treatment was 9.3 months or 19.7 months, respectively (PMID: 28588020). Overall response also varied by IDH2 mutation, with the ORR for patients with IDH2 R140 mutations (n=130) being 35.4% and for those with IDH2 R172 mutations (n=45) being 53.3% (PMID: 28588020).
