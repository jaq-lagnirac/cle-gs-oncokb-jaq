    "description":"This mutation occurs in the intronic regions flanking exon 14 of MET (PMID: 16397241, 19096300, 15735036). It results in alternative splicing of the gene with in-frame loss of the region encoded by exon 14, a region within the juxtamembrane domain of MET. The splice variant displays loss of binding to the MET negative regulator CBL, increased MET protein levels, enhanced downstream MET signaling, and promotion of cell growth (PMID: 25971939, 26729443, 25971938, 26215952). A patient with non-small cell lung cancer who progressed on osimertinib after developing a MET exon 14 splice mutation had partial response to and clinical benefit from combination osimertinib plus crizotinib (Abstract: Suzawa et al.

NCCN recommendation is based on evidence showing activity of crizotinib in patients with NSCLC with MET amplification or exon 14 skipping mutations (PMID: 21623265). In a study of twelve evaluable patients with c-MET amplified NSCLC, four patients had partial responses (33%) with a median duration of response of 35 weeks (Abstract: Camidge et al. Abstract# 8001, ASCO 2014. http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/132030-144). In another study of four patients with NSCLC harboring MET exon 14 skipping mutations, three patients who were treated with crizotinib had a partial response to therapy (PMID: 25971939). A retrospective analysis also identified a patient with lung cancer harboring amplification of a mutant MET allele who had a major partial response to crizotinib (PMID: 26729443). In a study of crizotinib in 26 patients with MET-altered NSCLC, the objective response rate was 27%, median progression-free survival at the time of cutoff was 4.4 months (95% CI 3.0-5.8), and overall survival was 5.4 months (95% CI= 4.2-6.5) (PMID: 31416808). In a study of crizotinib in patients with MET exon 14-altered NSCLC, the overall response rate in the 65 tumor-evaluable patients was 32% (95% CI= 21-45) with three patients (5%) achieving a confirmed complete response, eighteen (28%) achieving a confirmed partial response and 29 (45%) achieving stable disease (PMID: 31932802).",
