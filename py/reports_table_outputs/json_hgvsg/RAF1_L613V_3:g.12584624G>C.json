This mutation has been observed in patients with Noonan syndrome, a RASopathy with germline activation of the MAPK pathway (PMID: 21339642). Mouse models harboring this mutation are associated with elevated phospho-MEK and phospho-ERK activity as well as increased heterodimerization with BRAF, and this is linked to features of primary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (PMID: 22826437, 21339642, 28548091).
