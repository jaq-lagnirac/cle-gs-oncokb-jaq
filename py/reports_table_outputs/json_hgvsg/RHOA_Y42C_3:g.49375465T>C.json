    "description":"The RHOA Y42C mutation is located in the highly conserved core effector domain of the RHOA protein. This domain is an important binding site for other proteins mediating activation or inactivation of RHOA (PMID: 24816255). This mutation has been found in diffuse gastric cancer (PMID: 31771969). Expression of this mutation in vitro and in a transgenic mouse model demonstrated that it is activating as measured by decreased GTP hydrolysis and increased pathway activation compared to wildtype and the in vivo development of diffuse gastric cancer with concurrent CDH1 deletion (PMID: 31771969). Knockdown of the endogenous expression of this mutation in a gastric cancer cell line resulted in decreased proliferation (PMID: 24816255). However, expression of this mutation in human embryonic kidney cells led to decreased RHOA signaling as measured by reduced RHOA-GTP levels (PMID: 24816253).",
