    "description":"The ERBB2 I654V mutation is located in the kinase domain of the protein. This mutation has been found as a germline mutation in familial breast cancer (PMID:15550452,19336545). There is conflicting functional data for this mutation. Expression of this mutation in a murine B-cell line demonstrated that it is neutral as measured by no change in protein activation or growth factor-independent proliferation compared to wildtype (Abstract: Kancha et. al, AACR Annual Meeting 2009, Abstract # 1766. http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/69/9_Supplement/1766). However, computational analysis of this mutation in combination with ERBB2 I655V demonstrated that together both mutations may increase protein activity (PMID: 15550452). This mutation is associated with an increased risk for breast cancer (odds ratio= 2.56), particularly in women over the age of forty (odds ratio= 2.86) (PMID: 15550452).",
