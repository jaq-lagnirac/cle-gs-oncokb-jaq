    "description":"Truncating mutations in TCF3 can occur throughout the entire gene and are predicted to lead to loss of its activity (PMID: 29625055). TCF3 encodes a member of the E protein family of helix-loop-helix transcription factors, and it has been shown to be involved in lymphocyte, skin and neural development by regulating the Wnt signaling pathway (PMID: 25990863,17018284, 24832538). Chromosomal translocations involving TCF3 have been shown to be associated with the development of several lymphoid malignancies (PMID: 25729575, 27461063, 31575852). Germline truncating mutations in TCF3 have been shown to lead to severe hypogammaglobulinemia and predispose to B-ALL (PMID: 30063982, 28532655). Additionally, somatic truncating mutations in TCF3 have been identified in patients with several types of carcinomas (PMID: 29625055)",
