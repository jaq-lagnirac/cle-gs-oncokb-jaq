    "description":"The EGFR T725M mutation is located in the kinase domain of the EGFR protein. This mutation has been found in non-small cell lung cancers, among others (PMID: 24743239, 31931137). In vitro studies have demonstrated that this mutation is activating as measured by increased EGFR autophosphorylation compared to wildtype (PMID: 24743239). The EGFR T725M mutation has been identified as a possible sensitizing mutation to the kinase inhibitor afatinib and preclinical models with the T725M mutation show high sensitivity to first-, second-, third-generation, and ex20ins-active EGFR inhibitors (PMID: 31931137, 34526717).",
