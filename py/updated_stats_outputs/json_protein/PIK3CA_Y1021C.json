    "description":"The PIK3CA Y1021C mutation is located in the C-terminus of the protein. This mutation has been found in glioblastoma (PMID: 31996845). There is conflicting functional data for this mutation. Expression of this mutation in Ba/F3 cells demonstrated that it was activating as measured by increased growth factor-independent proliferation (PMID: 29533785). However, expression of this mutation in MCF10A cells and in a transgenic mouse model demonstrated that it is neutral as measured by failure to induce growth factor-independent proliferation or in vivo glioblastoma formation (PMID: 29533785, 31996845).",
