In the absence of GAP activity, TSC2 is likely unable to inhibit RHEB, even if the other two members (TSC1 and TBC1D7) of the TSC complex are intact, which can causes constitutive activation of the mTOR pathway (PMID: 14729330, 24529379) consistent with the oncogenic role of these mutations. Cells depleted of TSC2 display constitutive activation of the mTOR pathway and are sensitive to the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin (PMID: 14561707, 25724664).",

FDA approval is based on the results of a Phase III clinical trial of everolimus in patients with SEGA associated with TSC in which 35% of patients receiving everolimus (27 of 78 patients) experienced a reduction of at least 50% in the total volume of all targetable SEGAs versus no patients in the placebo group (PMID: 23158522). Patients in the everolimus group responded to the drug irrespective of whether they had a TSC1 or TSC2 mutation, although a higher percentage of patients with TSC1 mutations responded (five of ten patients, 50%) compared to those with TSC2 mutations (sixteen of 55 patients, 29%) (PMID: 23158522).",
