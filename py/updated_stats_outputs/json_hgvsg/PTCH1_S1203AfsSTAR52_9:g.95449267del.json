    "description":"PTCH1 truncating mutations result in the formation of several C-terminally truncated PTCH1 protein forms. These mutations have been found in patients with Gorlin syndrome and are thought to result in loss of protein activity, resulting in uncontrolled signaling and increased cell cycle progression through the oncogenic hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway (PMID: 8782823, 24840883). Cells harboring truncating mutations of PTCH1 are sensitive to treatment with inhibitors of smoothened such as sonidegib and vismodegib (PMID: 24523439, 22670903).",
