Expression of this mutation in a cervical cancer cell line demonstrated that it is activating as measured by increased protein activity compared to wildtype, and endogenous expression of this mutation in melanoma and endometrial cancer samples showed increased protein expression compared to normal melanocytes (PMID: 22815287, 9065403).",
