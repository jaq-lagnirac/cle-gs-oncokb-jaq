    "description":"The VHL L89H mutation is located in the VHL beta domain of the protein. This mutation has been identified in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and is a statistically significant hotspot (PMID: 21715564). In vitro studies with NCI-H28 malignant pleural mesothelioma cells expressing VHL L89H demonstrate that the mutation is inactivating as measured by increased HIF1a expression compared to wildtype (PMID: 32234874). VHL L89H is suggested to be sensitive to treatment with HIF1a inhibitor YC-1 as measured by dose-and-time-dependent manner induction of apoptosis in cells following treatment (PMID: 32234874).",
