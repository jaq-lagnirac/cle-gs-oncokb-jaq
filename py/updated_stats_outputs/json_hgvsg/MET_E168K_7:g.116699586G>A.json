    "description":"The MET E168D mutation is located in the extracellular sema domain of the protein. This mutation has been found in lung cancer (PMID: 14559814). Expression of this mutation in COS7 cells demonstrated that it is likely activating as measured by modestly increased ligand binding and increased apoptosis with MET inhibition compared to wildtype (PMID: 19723643). The small-molecule inhibitor SU11274 was able to inhibit the activity of this mutation (PMID: 19318576) (Abstract: Ma et al.
