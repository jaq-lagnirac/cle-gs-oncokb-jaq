When found in the germline, these mutations result in ataxia-telangiectasia syndrome, which increases cancer predisposition, including a 20% to 30% lifetime risk of lymphoid, gastric, breast, central nervous system, skin, and other cancers (PMID: 27413114).

FDA approval was based on the results of the Phase III PROfound trial of olaparib in adult patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had disease progression while receiving a new hormonal agent and who had a deleterious or suspected deleterious mutation in a homologous recombination repair gene. Of patients with BRCA2 (n=128), BRCA1 (n=13) or ATM mutations (n=86), the progression-free survival in the olaparib group was 7.4 months compared to 3.6 months in the placebo group (HR= 0.34; 95% CI=0.25 to 0.47; p<0.001), with a median overall survival of 18.5 months versus 15.1 months (HR=0.64; 95% CI=0.43 to 0.97; p=0.02) and an overall response rate of 33% versus 2% (p=0.02), respectively (PMID: 32343890).
