    "description":"Truncating mutations in CHEK1 have been found in the C-terminus and kinase domains, and result in shortened, non-functional peptides (PMID: 18716058, 14681223, 23508805). Originally identified as a mediator of DNA damage response, CHEK1 is a tumor suppressor that induces cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase by phosphorylating CDK1, among other mechanisms (PMID: 23508805). Heterozygous loss of this gene, but not full loss, has been shown to induce tumor formation in WNT1 oncogenic mice (PMID:10859164). Truncating mutations in CHEK1 have been identified in patients with stomach, endometrial and colorectal cancers (PMID: 12124347, 10757443, 11691784).",

FDA approval was based on the results of the Phase III PROfound trial of olaparib in adult patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had disease progression while receiving a new hormonal agent and who had a deleterious or suspected deleterious mutation in a homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene. Of patients with a qualifying alteration in an HRR gene, the progression-free survival in the olaparib group was 5.8 months compared to 3.5 months in the placebo group (HR=0.49; 95% CI=0.38 to 0.63; p<0.001), with a median overall survival of 17.5 months versus 14.3 months (0.67; 95% CI=0.49 to 0.93) and an overall response rate of 22% versus 4%, respectively (PMID: 32343890).
