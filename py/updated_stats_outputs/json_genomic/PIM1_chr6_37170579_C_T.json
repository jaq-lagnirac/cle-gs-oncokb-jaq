    "description":"The PIM1 L2V mutation occurs in the N terminus of the protein, prior to a kinase domain. In a lymphoma cell line, expression of L2V did not alter cell proliferation or viability compared to the wildtype. In a colony formation assay, however, the mutated protein altered morphology and increased the number of colonies. Additionally, the L2V mutation increased protein stability and decreased sensitivity to inhibitor compound ibrutinib. Expression of the mutant also modulated expression of modulators and effectors in the NF\u03baB pathway (PMID: 27904766).",
