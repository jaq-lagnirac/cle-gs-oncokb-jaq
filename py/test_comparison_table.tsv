Expression of this mutation in TP53-null cell lines resulted in aggregation of unfolded mutant proteins, likely leading to destabilization of TP53 and upregulation of heat shock proteins (PMID: 21445056). Expression of this mutation in osteosarcoma cell lines led to a reduced apoptotic response, including reduced expression of pro-apoptotic proteins (PMID: 16778209). In biochemical assays, this mutation was found to bind DNA with a lower affinity than wildtype TP53 (PMID: 24814347).

Human breast cancer cell lines that contain a truncating mutation in BRCA1 display elevated levels of aneuploidy and impaired DNA damage response. In addition, truncating mutations have been shown to induce aberrant protein localization, which may impact the interaction of important binding partners (PMID: 20608970).
