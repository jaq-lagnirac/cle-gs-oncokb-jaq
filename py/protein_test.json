In addition, truncating mutations have been shown to induce aberrant protein localization, which may impact the interaction of important binding partners (PMID: 20608970).

This drug is considered standard-of-care for the treatment of patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. Initial FDA approval was based on Phase I and Phase II clinical trials evaluating patients with ovarian cancer harboring known BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations, in which treatment with olaparib demonstrated a clear clinical benefit. Specifically, in a Phase II trial evaluating olaparib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and a confirmed germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (n=193), the tumor response rate was 31% (95% CI=24.6 to 38.1), and stable disease (around 8 weeks) was seen in 40% of patients (95% CI=33.4 to 47.7) (PMID: 25366685). More recent FDA approval was based on a planned retrospective analysis of Phase II trial data in which patients with deleterious BRCA mutations had significantly longer progression-free survival with olaparib maintenance therapy than patients given placebo (11.2 months vs 4.3 months; HR=0.18; p<0\u00b70001)(PMID: 24882434). In the seven-year follow-up of the Phase III SOLO1/GOG-3004 trial of maintenance olaparib versus placebo in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer harboring a BRCA mutation, the seven-year median overall survival rates were 67% in the olaparib arm and 46.5% in the placebo arm, and the median duration of treatment was 24.6 months with olaparib and 13.9 months with placebo (PMID: 36082969)."

FDA approval is based on two early-phase studies (Study 10 and ARIEL2) in which a total of 106 women with previously-treated high-grade ovarian cancer (HGOC) harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 were treated with rucaparib (PMID: 28882436). In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037). The NCCN v5.2022 lists rucaparib as a maintenance therapy for patients with BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer."

FDA approval was based on the Phase III NOVA trial of niraparib versus placebo in patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer with or without BRCA1/2 mutations in which patients in the germline BRCA mutant cohort (n=203) experienced significantly longer progression-free survival with niraparib than those in the placebo group (21.0 vs. 5.5 months; HR=0.27; 95% CI = 0.17-0.41) (PMID: 27717299). FDA approval of niraparib in the non-germline BRCA mutant patient cohort (n=350) was based on the results of improved progression-free survival with niraparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy (9.3 months vs. 3.9 months; HR=0.45; 95% CI= 0.34-0.61) in the overall non-germline BRCA cohort. However, the overall non-germline BRCA cohort included patients with somatic BRCA mutation (PMID: 27717299). Further studies have shown the efficacy of niraparib in patients with homologous-recombination-deficient, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, including patients with BRCA mutation (PMID: 30948273, 31562799). The NCCN v5.2022 lists niraparib as a maintenance therapy for patients with BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer."

FDA approval is based on two early-phase studies (Study 10 and ARIEL2) in which a total of 106 women with previously-treated high-grade ovarian cancer (HGOC) harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 were treated with rucaparib (PMID: 28882436). In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037). The NCCN v5.2022 lists rucaparib as a maintenance therapy for patients with BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer."

FDA approval was based on the Phase III NOVA trial of niraparib versus placebo in patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer with or without BRCA1/2 mutations in which patients in the germline BRCA mutant cohort (n=203) experienced significantly longer progression-free survival with niraparib than those in the placebo group (21.0 vs. 5.5 months; HR=0.27; 95% CI = 0.17-0.41) (PMID: 27717299).

Specifically, in a Phase II trial evaluating olaparib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and a confirmed germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (n=193), the tumor response rate was 31% (95% CI=24.6 to 38.1), and stable disease (around 8 weeks) was seen in 40% of patients (95% CI=33.4 to 47.7) (PMID: 25366685). More recent FDA approval was based on a planned retrospective analysis of Phase II trial data in which patients with deleterious BRCA mutations had significantly longer progression-free survival with olaparib maintenance therapy than patients given placebo (11.2 months vs 4.3 months; HR=0.18; p<0\u00b70001)(PMID: 24882434). In the seven-year follow-up of the Phase III SOLO1/GOG-3004 trial of maintenance olaparib versus placebo in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer harboring a BRCA mutation, the seven-year median overall survival rates were 67% in the olaparib arm and 46.5% in the placebo arm, and the median duration of treatment was 24.6 months with olaparib and 13.9 months with placebo (PMID: 36082969)."

FDA approval is based on two early-phase studies (Study 10 and ARIEL2) in which a total of 106 women with previously-treated high-grade ovarian cancer (HGOC) harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 were treated with rucaparib (PMID: 28882436). In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037). The NCCN v5.2022 lists rucaparib as a maintenance therapy for patients with BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer."

FDA approval is based on two early-phase studies (Study 10 and ARIEL2) in which a total of 106 women with previously-treated high-grade ovarian cancer (HGOC) harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 were treated with rucaparib (PMID: 28882436). In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037). The NCCN v5.2022 lists rucaparib as a maintenance therapy for patients with BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer."

FDA approval was based on the results from the Phase III EMBRACA trial of talazoparib (1 mg once daily) versus standard single-agent chemotherapy (2:1) in 431 patients with advanced, BRCA1/2 germline-mutated breast cancer in which the median progression-free survival was 8.6 months in the talazoparib group versus 5.6 months in the chemotherapy group (HR= 0.54; 95%CI=0.41 to 0.71; p<0.001) and the objective response rate was 62.6% in the talazoparib group versus 27.2% in the chemotherapy group (p<0.001) (PMID: 30110579). In the Phase II study of talazoparib in patients with germline BRCA-mutant breast cancer who had a prior response to platinum agents, the overall response rate was 21-37% (depending on cohort) (PMID: 30563931).

FDA approval is based on two early-phase studies (Study 10 and ARIEL2) in which a total of 106 women with previously-treated high-grade ovarian cancer (HGOC) harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 were treated with rucaparib (PMID: 28882436). In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037).

In the seven-year follow-up of the Phase III SOLO1/GOG-3004 trial of maintenance olaparib versus placebo in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer harboring a BRCA mutation, the seven-year median overall survival rates were 67% in the olaparib arm and 46.5% in the placebo arm, and the median duration of treatment was 24.6 months with olaparib and 13.9 months with placebo (PMID: 36082969)."

In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037).

This drug is considered standard-of-care for the treatment of patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. Initial FDA approval was based on Phase I and Phase II clinical trials evaluating patients with ovarian cancer harboring known BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations, in which treatment with olaparib demonstrated a clear clinical benefit. Specifically, in a Phase II trial evaluating olaparib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and a confirmed germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (n=193), the tumor response rate was 31% (95% CI=24.6 to 38.1), and stable disease (around 8 weeks) was seen in 40% of patients (95% CI=33.4 to 47.7) (PMID: 25366685). More recent FDA approval was based on a planned retrospective analysis of Phase II trial data in which patients with deleterious BRCA mutations had significantly longer progression-free survival with olaparib maintenance therapy than patients given placebo (11.2 months vs 4.3 months; HR=0.18; p<0\u00b70001)(PMID: 24882434). In the seven-year follow-up of the Phase III SOLO1/GOG-3004 trial of maintenance olaparib versus placebo in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer harboring a BRCA mutation, the seven-year median overall survival rates were 67% in the olaparib arm and 46.5% in the placebo arm, and the median duration of treatment was 24.6 months with olaparib and 13.9 months with placebo (PMID: 36082969)."

In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037).

Human breast cancer cell lines that contain a truncating mutation in BRCA1 display elevated levels of aneuploidy and impaired DNA damage response. In addition, truncating mutations have been shown to induce aberrant protein localization, which may impact the interaction of important binding partners (PMID: 20608970). Mouse models of BRCA1 truncating mutations develop cancer, including mammary carcinomas, lymphomas and ovarian carcinomas (PMID: 11358863, 12483515, 12947386).",

This drug is considered standard-of-care for the treatment of patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. Initial FDA approval was based on Phase I and Phase II clinical trials evaluating patients with ovarian cancer harboring known BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations, in which treatment with olaparib demonstrated a clear clinical benefit. Specifically, in a Phase II trial evaluating olaparib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and a confirmed germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (n=193), the tumor response rate was 31% (95% CI=24.6 to 38.1), and stable disease (around 8 weeks) was seen in 40% of patients (95% CI=33.4 to 47.7) (PMID: 25366685). More recent FDA approval was based on a planned retrospective analysis of Phase II trial data in which patients with deleterious BRCA mutations had significantly longer progression-free survival with olaparib maintenance therapy than patients given placebo (11.2 months vs 4.3 months; HR=0.18; p<0\u00b70001)(PMID: 24882434). In the seven-year follow-up of the Phase III SOLO1/GOG-3004 trial of maintenance olaparib versus placebo in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer harboring a BRCA mutation, the seven-year median overall survival rates were 67% in the olaparib arm and 46.5% in the placebo arm, and the median duration of treatment was 24.6 months with olaparib and 13.9 months with placebo (PMID: 36082969)."

FDA approval is based on two early-phase studies (Study 10 and ARIEL2) in which a total of 106 women with previously-treated high-grade ovarian cancer (HGOC) harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 were treated with rucaparib (PMID: 28882436). In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037). The NCCN v5.2022 lists rucaparib as a maintenance therapy for patients with BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer."

FDA approval was based on the Phase III NOVA trial of niraparib versus placebo in patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer with or without BRCA1/2 mutations in which patients in the germline BRCA mutant cohort (n=203) experienced significantly longer progression-free survival with niraparib than those in the placebo group (21.0 vs. 5.5 months; HR=0.27; 95% CI = 0.17-0.41) (PMID: 27717299). FDA approval of niraparib in the non-germline BRCA mutant patient cohort (n=350) was based on the results of improved progression-free survival with niraparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy (9.3 months vs. 3.9 months; HR=0.45; 95% CI= 0.34-0.61) in the overall non-germline BRCA cohort. However, the overall non-germline BRCA cohort included patients with somatic BRCA mutation (PMID: 27717299). Further studies have shown the efficacy of niraparib in patients with homologous-recombination-deficient, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, including patients with BRCA mutation (PMID: 30948273, 31562799). The NCCN v5.2022 lists niraparib as a maintenance therapy for patients with BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer."

This drug is considered standard-of-care for the treatment of patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. Initial FDA approval was based on Phase I and Phase II clinical trials evaluating patients with ovarian cancer harboring known BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations, in which treatment with olaparib demonstrated a clear clinical benefit. Specifically, in a Phase II trial evaluating olaparib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and a confirmed germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (n=193), the tumor response rate was 31% (95% CI=24.6 to 38.1), and stable disease (around 8 weeks) was seen in 40% of patients (95% CI=33.4 to 47.7) (PMID: 25366685).

FDA approval is based on two early-phase studies (Study 10 and ARIEL2) in which a total of 106 women with previously-treated high-grade ovarian cancer (HGOC) harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 were treated with rucaparib (PMID: 28882436). In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037). The NCCN v5.2022 lists rucaparib as a maintenance therapy for patients with BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer."

FDA approval was based on the Phase III NOVA trial of niraparib versus placebo in patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer with or without BRCA1/2 mutations in which patients in the germline BRCA mutant cohort (n=203) experienced significantly longer progression-free survival with niraparib than those in the placebo group (21.0 vs. 5.5 months; HR=0.27; 95% CI = 0.17-0.41) (PMID: 27717299).

FDA approval is based on two early-phase studies (Study 10 and ARIEL2) in which a total of 106 women with previously-treated high-grade ovarian cancer (HGOC) harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 were treated with rucaparib (PMID: 28882436). In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037). The NCCN v5.2022 lists rucaparib as a maintenance therapy for patients with BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer."

FDA approval was based on the results from the Phase III EMBRACA trial of talazoparib (1 mg once daily) versus standard single-agent chemotherapy (2:1) in 431 patients with advanced, BRCA1/2 germline-mutated breast cancer in which the median progression-free survival was 8.6 months in the talazoparib group versus 5.6 months in the chemotherapy group (HR= 0.54; 95%CI=0.41 to 0.71; p<0.001) and the objective response rate was 62.6% in the talazoparib group versus 27.2% in the chemotherapy group (p<0.001) (PMID: 30110579). In the Phase II study of talazoparib in patients with germline BRCA-mutant breast cancer who had a prior response to platinum agents, the overall response rate was 21-37% (depending on cohort) (PMID: 30563931).

In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037).

This drug is considered standard-of-care for the treatment of patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. Initial FDA approval was based on Phase I and Phase II clinical trials evaluating patients with ovarian cancer harboring known BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations, in which treatment with olaparib demonstrated a clear clinical benefit. Specifically, in a Phase II trial evaluating olaparib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and a confirmed germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (n=193), the tumor response rate was 31% (95% CI=24.6 to 38.1), and stable disease (around 8 weeks) was seen in 40% of patients (95% CI=33.4 to 47.7) (PMID: 25366685). More recent FDA approval was based on a planned retrospective analysis of Phase II trial data in which patients with deleterious BRCA mutations had significantly longer progression-free survival with olaparib maintenance therapy than patients given placebo (11.2 months vs 4.3 months; HR=0.18; p<0\u00b70001)(PMID: 24882434). In the seven-year follow-up of the Phase III SOLO1/GOG-3004 trial of maintenance olaparib versus placebo in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer harboring a BRCA mutation, the seven-year median overall survival rates were 67% in the olaparib arm and 46.5% in the placebo arm, and the median duration of treatment was 24.6 months with olaparib and 13.9 months with placebo (PMID: 36082969)."

FDA approval is based on two early-phase studies (Study 10 and ARIEL2) in which a total of 106 women with previously-treated high-grade ovarian cancer (HGOC) harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 were treated with rucaparib (PMID: 28882436). In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037). The NCCN v5.2022 lists rucaparib as a maintenance therapy for patients with BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer."

FDA approval is based on two early-phase studies (Study 10 and ARIEL2) in which a total of 106 women with previously-treated high-grade ovarian cancer (HGOC) harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 were treated with rucaparib (PMID: 28882436). In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037).

This drug is considered standard-of-care for the treatment of patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. Initial FDA approval was based on Phase I and Phase II clinical trials evaluating patients with ovarian cancer harboring known BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations, in which treatment with olaparib demonstrated a clear clinical benefit. Specifically, in a Phase II trial evaluating olaparib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and a confirmed germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (n=193), the tumor response rate was 31% (95% CI=24.6 to 38.1), and stable disease (around 8 weeks) was seen in 40% of patients (95% CI=33.4 to 47.7) (PMID: 25366685). More recent FDA approval was based on a planned retrospective analysis of Phase II trial data in which patients with deleterious BRCA mutations had significantly longer progression-free survival with olaparib maintenance therapy than patients given placebo (11.2 months vs 4.3 months; HR=0.18; p<0\u00b70001)(PMID: 24882434). In the seven-year follow-up of the Phase III SOLO1/GOG-3004 trial of maintenance olaparib versus placebo in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer harboring a BRCA mutation, the seven-year median overall survival rates were 67% in the olaparib arm and 46.5% in the placebo arm, and the median duration of treatment was 24.6 months with olaparib and 13.9 months with placebo (PMID: 36082969)."

In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037).

In addition, truncating mutations have been shown to induce aberrant protein localization, which may impact the interaction of important binding partners (PMID: 20608970).

This drug is considered standard-of-care for the treatment of patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. Initial FDA approval was based on Phase I and Phase II clinical trials evaluating patients with ovarian cancer harboring known BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations, in which treatment with olaparib demonstrated a clear clinical benefit. Specifically, in a Phase II trial evaluating olaparib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and a confirmed germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (n=193), the tumor response rate was 31% (95% CI=24.6 to 38.1), and stable disease (around 8 weeks) was seen in 40% of patients (95% CI=33.4 to 47.7) (PMID: 25366685). More recent FDA approval was based on a planned retrospective analysis of Phase II trial data in which patients with deleterious BRCA mutations had significantly longer progression-free survival with olaparib maintenance therapy than patients given placebo (11.2 months vs 4.3 months; HR=0.18; p<0\u00b70001)(PMID: 24882434). In the seven-year follow-up of the Phase III SOLO1/GOG-3004 trial of maintenance olaparib versus placebo in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer harboring a BRCA mutation, the seven-year median overall survival rates were 67% in the olaparib arm and 46.5% in the placebo arm, and the median duration of treatment was 24.6 months with olaparib and 13.9 months with placebo (PMID: 36082969)."

FDA approval was based on the Phase III NOVA trial of niraparib versus placebo in patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer with or without BRCA1/2 mutations in which patients in the germline BRCA mutant cohort (n=203) experienced significantly longer progression-free survival with niraparib than those in the placebo group (21.0 vs. 5.5 months; HR=0.27; 95% CI = 0.17-0.41) (PMID: 27717299). FDA approval of niraparib in the non-germline BRCA mutant patient cohort (n=350) was based on the results of improved progression-free survival with niraparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy (9.3 months vs. 3.9 months; HR=0.45; 95% CI= 0.34-0.61) in the overall non-germline BRCA cohort. However, the overall non-germline BRCA cohort included patients with somatic BRCA mutation (PMID: 27717299). Further studies have shown the efficacy of niraparib in patients with homologous-recombination-deficient, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, including patients with BRCA mutation (PMID: 30948273, 31562799). The NCCN v5.2022 lists niraparib as a maintenance therapy for patients with BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer."

In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367).

Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037). The NCCN v5.2022 lists rucaparib as a maintenance therapy for patients with BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer."

FDA approval was based on the Phase III NOVA trial of niraparib versus placebo in patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer with or without BRCA1/2 mutations in which patients in the germline BRCA mutant cohort (n=203) experienced significantly longer progression-free survival with niraparib than those in the placebo group (21.0 vs. 5.5 months; HR=0.27; 95% CI = 0.17-0.41) (PMID: 27717299). FDA approval of niraparib in the non-germline BRCA mutant patient cohort (n=350) was based on the results of improved progression-free survival with niraparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy (9.3 months vs. 3.9 months; HR=0.45; 95% CI= 0.34-0.61) in the overall non-germline BRCA cohort.

FDA approval is based on two early-phase studies (Study 10 and ARIEL2) in which a total of 106 women with previously-treated high-grade ovarian cancer (HGOC) harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 were treated with rucaparib (PMID: 28882436). In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037). The NCCN v5.2022 lists rucaparib as a maintenance therapy for patients with BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer."

FDA approval was based on the Phase III NOVA trial of niraparib versus placebo in patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer with or without BRCA1/2 mutations in which patients in the germline BRCA mutant cohort (n=203) experienced significantly longer progression-free survival with niraparib than those in the placebo group (21.0 vs. 5.5 months; HR=0.27; 95% CI = 0.17-0.41) (PMID: 27717299).

This drug is considered standard-of-care for the treatment of patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. Initial FDA approval was based on Phase I and Phase II clinical trials evaluating patients with ovarian cancer harboring known BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations, in which treatment with olaparib demonstrated a clear clinical benefit. Specifically, in a Phase II trial evaluating olaparib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and a confirmed germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (n=193), the tumor response rate was 31% (95% CI=24.6 to 38.1), and stable disease (around 8 weeks) was seen in 40% of patients (95% CI=33.4 to 47.7) (PMID: 25366685). More recent FDA approval was based on a planned retrospective analysis of Phase II trial data in which patients with deleterious BRCA mutations had significantly longer progression-free survival with olaparib maintenance therapy than patients given placebo (11.2 months vs 4.3 months; HR=0.18; p<0\u00b70001)(PMID: 24882434). In the seven-year follow-up of the Phase III SOLO1/GOG-3004 trial of maintenance olaparib versus placebo in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer harboring a BRCA mutation, the seven-year median overall survival rates were 67% in the olaparib arm and 46.5% in the placebo arm, and the median duration of treatment was 24.6 months with olaparib and 13.9 months with placebo (PMID: 36082969)."

This drug is considered standard-of-care for the treatment of patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. Initial FDA approval was based on Phase I and Phase II clinical trials evaluating patients with ovarian cancer harboring known BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations, in which treatment with olaparib demonstrated a clear clinical benefit.

In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037).

Abstract# 2527, ASCO 2017. https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2017.35.15_suppl.2527). In the Phase IIb tumor-agnostic JAVELIN BRCA/ATM trial of combination talazoparib and avelumab in 159 patients with BRCA1/2-altered solid tumors, the objective response was observed in 42 patients (26.4%, 95% CI = 19.7%\u201334.0%) and the median duration of response was 10.9 months (95% CI = 6.2 months to not estimable) (PMID: 36394867)."

FDA approval is based on two early-phase studies (Study 10 and ARIEL2) in which a total of 106 women with previously-treated high-grade ovarian cancer (HGOC) harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 were treated with rucaparib (PMID: 28882436). In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037).

This drug is considered standard-of-care for the treatment of patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. Initial FDA approval was based on Phase I and Phase II clinical trials evaluating patients with ovarian cancer harboring known BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations, in which treatment with olaparib demonstrated a clear clinical benefit. Specifically, in a Phase II trial evaluating olaparib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and a confirmed germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (n=193), the tumor response rate was 31% (95% CI=24.6 to 38.1), and stable disease (around 8 weeks) was seen in 40% of patients (95% CI=33.4 to 47.7) (PMID: 25366685). More recent FDA approval was based on a planned retrospective analysis of Phase II trial data in which patients with deleterious BRCA mutations had significantly longer progression-free survival with olaparib maintenance therapy than patients given placebo (11.2 months vs 4.3 months; HR=0.18; p<0\u00b70001)(PMID: 24882434). In the seven-year follow-up of the Phase III SOLO1/GOG-3004 trial of maintenance olaparib versus placebo in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer harboring a BRCA mutation, the seven-year median overall survival rates were 67% in the olaparib arm and 46.5% in the placebo arm, and the median duration of treatment was 24.6 months with olaparib and 13.9 months with placebo (PMID: 36082969)."

FDA approval is based on two early-phase studies (Study 10 and ARIEL2) in which a total of 106 women with previously-treated high-grade ovarian cancer (HGOC) harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 were treated with rucaparib (PMID: 28882436). In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037).

This drug is considered standard-of-care for the treatment of patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. Initial FDA approval was based on Phase I and Phase II clinical trials evaluating patients with ovarian cancer harboring known BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations, in which treatment with olaparib demonstrated a clear clinical benefit. Specifically, in a Phase II trial evaluating olaparib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and a confirmed germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (n=193), the tumor response rate was 31% (95% CI=24.6 to 38.1), and stable disease (around 8 weeks) was seen in 40% of patients (95% CI=33.4 to 47.7) (PMID: 25366685). More recent FDA approval was based on a planned retrospective analysis of Phase II trial data in which patients with deleterious BRCA mutations had significantly longer progression-free survival with olaparib maintenance therapy than patients given placebo (11.2 months vs 4.3 months; HR=0.18; p<0\u00b70001)(PMID: 24882434). In the seven-year follow-up of the Phase III SOLO1/GOG-3004 trial of maintenance olaparib versus placebo in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer harboring a BRCA mutation, the seven-year median overall survival rates were 67% in the olaparib arm and 46.5% in the placebo arm, and the median duration of treatment was 24.6 months with olaparib and 13.9 months with placebo (PMID: 36082969)."

In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037).

This drug is considered standard-of-care for the treatment of patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. Initial FDA approval was based on Phase I and Phase II clinical trials evaluating patients with ovarian cancer harboring known BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations, in which treatment with olaparib demonstrated a clear clinical benefit. Specifically, in a Phase II trial evaluating olaparib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and a confirmed germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (n=193), the tumor response rate was 31% (95% CI=24.6 to 38.1), and stable disease (around 8 weeks) was seen in 40% of patients (95% CI=33.4 to 47.7) (PMID: 25366685). More recent FDA approval was based on a planned retrospective analysis of Phase II trial data in which patients with deleterious BRCA mutations had significantly longer progression-free survival with olaparib maintenance therapy than patients given placebo (11.2 months vs 4.3 months; HR=0.18; p<0\u00b70001)(PMID: 24882434). In the seven-year follow-up of the Phase III SOLO1/GOG-3004 trial of maintenance olaparib versus placebo in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer harboring a BRCA mutation, the seven-year median overall survival rates were 67% in the olaparib arm and 46.5% in the placebo arm, and the median duration of treatment was 24.6 months with olaparib and 13.9 months with placebo (PMID: 36082969)."

In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037).

Human breast cancer cell lines that contain a truncating mutation in BRCA1 display elevated levels of aneuploidy and impaired DNA damage response. In addition, truncating mutations have been shown to induce aberrant protein localization, which may impact the interaction of important binding partners (PMID: 20608970). Mouse models of BRCA1 truncating mutations develop cancer, including mammary carcinomas, lymphomas and ovarian carcinomas (PMID: 11358863, 12483515, 12947386).",

This drug is considered standard-of-care for the treatment of patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. Initial FDA approval was based on Phase I and Phase II clinical trials evaluating patients with ovarian cancer harboring known BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations, in which treatment with olaparib demonstrated a clear clinical benefit. Specifically, in a Phase II trial evaluating olaparib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and a confirmed germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (n=193), the tumor response rate was 31% (95% CI=24.6 to 38.1), and stable disease (around 8 weeks) was seen in 40% of patients (95% CI=33.4 to 47.7) (PMID: 25366685). More recent FDA approval was based on a planned retrospective analysis of Phase II trial data in which patients with deleterious BRCA mutations had significantly longer progression-free survival with olaparib maintenance therapy than patients given placebo (11.2 months vs 4.3 months; HR=0.18; p<0\u00b70001)(PMID: 24882434). In the seven-year follow-up of the Phase III SOLO1/GOG-3004 trial of maintenance olaparib versus placebo in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer harboring a BRCA mutation, the seven-year median overall survival rates were 67% in the olaparib arm and 46.5% in the placebo arm, and the median duration of treatment was 24.6 months with olaparib and 13.9 months with placebo (PMID: 36082969)."

FDA approval is based on two early-phase studies (Study 10 and ARIEL2) in which a total of 106 women with previously-treated high-grade ovarian cancer (HGOC) harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 were treated with rucaparib (PMID: 28882436). In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037). The NCCN v5.2022 lists rucaparib as a maintenance therapy for patients with BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer."

FDA approval was based on the Phase III NOVA trial of niraparib versus placebo in patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer with or without BRCA1/2 mutations in which patients in the germline BRCA mutant cohort (n=203) experienced significantly longer progression-free survival with niraparib than those in the placebo group (21.0 vs. 5.5 months; HR=0.27; 95% CI = 0.17-0.41) (PMID: 27717299). FDA approval of niraparib in the non-germline BRCA mutant patient cohort (n=350) was based on the results of improved progression-free survival with niraparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy (9.3 months vs. 3.9 months; HR=0.45; 95% CI= 0.34-0.61) in the overall non-germline BRCA cohort. However, the overall non-germline BRCA cohort included patients with somatic BRCA mutation (PMID: 27717299). Further studies have shown the efficacy of niraparib in patients with homologous-recombination-deficient, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, including patients with BRCA mutation (PMID: 30948273, 31562799). The NCCN v5.2022 lists niraparib as a maintenance therapy for patients with BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer."

This drug is considered standard-of-care for the treatment of patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations.

                "description": "Rucaparib, a small molecule PARP inhibitor, is FDA-approved for maintenance therapy of adult patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. FDA approval is based on two early-phase studies (Study 10 and ARIEL2) in which a total of 106 women with previously-treated high-grade ovarian cancer (HGOC) harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 were treated with rucaparib (PMID: 28882436). In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037). The NCCN v5.2022 lists rucaparib as a maintenance therapy for patients with BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer."

FDA approval was based on the Phase III NOVA trial of niraparib versus placebo in patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer with or without BRCA1/2 mutations in which patients in the germline BRCA mutant cohort (n=203) experienced significantly longer progression-free survival with niraparib than those in the placebo group (21.0 vs. 5.5 months; HR=0.27; 95% CI = 0.17-0.41) (PMID: 27717299).

In the seven-year follow-up of the Phase III SOLO1/GOG-3004 trial of maintenance olaparib versus placebo in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer harboring a BRCA mutation, the seven-year median overall survival rates were 67% in the olaparib arm and 46.5% in the placebo arm, and the median duration of treatment was 24.6 months with olaparib and 13.9 months with placebo (PMID: 36082969)."

FDA approval is based on two early-phase studies (Study 10 and ARIEL2) in which a total of 106 women with previously-treated high-grade ovarian cancer (HGOC) harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 were treated with rucaparib (PMID: 28882436). In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037). The NCCN v5.2022 lists rucaparib as a maintenance therapy for patients with BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer."

FDA approval is based on two early-phase studies (Study 10 and ARIEL2) in which a total of 106 women with previously-treated high-grade ovarian cancer (HGOC) harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 were treated with rucaparib (PMID: 28882436). In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037). The NCCN v5.2022 lists rucaparib as a maintenance therapy for patients with BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer."

FDA approval was based on the results from the Phase III EMBRACA trial of talazoparib (1 mg once daily) versus standard single-agent chemotherapy (2:1) in 431 patients with advanced, BRCA1/2 germline-mutated breast cancer in which the median progression-free survival was 8.6 months in the talazoparib group versus 5.6 months in the chemotherapy group (HR= 0.54; 95%CI=0.41 to 0.71; p<0.001) and the objective response rate was 62.6% in the talazoparib group versus 27.2% in the chemotherapy group (p<0.001) (PMID: 30110579). In the Phase II study of talazoparib in patients with germline BRCA-mutant breast cancer who had a prior response to platinum agents, the overall response rate was 21-37% (depending on cohort) (PMID: 30563931). In a Phase I study of talazoparib plus carboplatin in patients with and without DNA repair mutations, three patients with somatic BRCA mutations had stable disease beyond four months (Abstract: Dhawan et al.

FDA approval is based on two early-phase studies (Study 10 and ARIEL2) in which a total of 106 women with previously-treated high-grade ovarian cancer (HGOC) harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 were treated with rucaparib (PMID: 28882436). In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037).

This drug is considered standard-of-care for the treatment of patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. Initial FDA approval was based on Phase I and Phase II clinical trials evaluating patients with ovarian cancer harboring known BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations, in which treatment with olaparib demonstrated a clear clinical benefit.

In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037).

This drug is considered standard-of-care for the treatment of patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. Initial FDA approval was based on Phase I and Phase II clinical trials evaluating patients with ovarian cancer harboring known BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations, in which treatment with olaparib demonstrated a clear clinical benefit. Specifically, in a Phase II trial evaluating olaparib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and a confirmed germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (n=193), the tumor response rate was 31% (95% CI=24.6 to 38.1), and stable disease (around 8 weeks) was seen in 40% of patients (95% CI=33.4 to 47.7) (PMID: 25366685). More recent FDA approval was based on a planned retrospective analysis of Phase II trial data in which patients with deleterious BRCA mutations had significantly longer progression-free survival with olaparib maintenance therapy than patients given placebo (11.2 months vs 4.3 months; HR=0.18; p<0\u00b70001)(PMID: 24882434). In the seven-year follow-up of the Phase III SOLO1/GOG-3004 trial of maintenance olaparib versus placebo in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer harboring a BRCA mutation, the seven-year median overall survival rates were 67% in the olaparib arm and 46.5% in the placebo arm, and the median duration of treatment was 24.6 months with olaparib and 13.9 months with placebo (PMID: 36082969)."

In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037).

Mouse models of BRCA1 truncating mutations develop cancer, including mammary carcinomas, lymphomas and ovarian carcinomas (PMID: 11358863, 12483515, 12947386).",

This drug is considered standard-of-care for the treatment of patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. Initial FDA approval was based on Phase I and Phase II clinical trials evaluating patients with ovarian cancer harboring known BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations, in which treatment with olaparib demonstrated a clear clinical benefit. Specifically, in a Phase II trial evaluating olaparib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and a confirmed germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (n=193), the tumor response rate was 31% (95% CI=24.6 to 38.1), and stable disease (around 8 weeks) was seen in 40% of patients (95% CI=33.4 to 47.7) (PMID: 25366685). More recent FDA approval was based on a planned retrospective analysis of Phase II trial data in which patients with deleterious BRCA mutations had significantly longer progression-free survival with olaparib maintenance therapy than patients given placebo (11.2 months vs 4.3 months; HR=0.18; p<0\u00b70001)(PMID: 24882434). In the seven-year follow-up of the Phase III SOLO1/GOG-3004 trial of maintenance olaparib versus placebo in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer harboring a BRCA mutation, the seven-year median overall survival rates were 67% in the olaparib arm and 46.5% in the placebo arm, and the median duration of treatment was 24.6 months with olaparib and 13.9 months with placebo (PMID: 36082969)."

FDA approval is based on two early-phase studies (Study 10 and ARIEL2) in which a total of 106 women with previously-treated high-grade ovarian cancer (HGOC) harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 were treated with rucaparib (PMID: 28882436). In the study population, 8.5% of 106 patients achieved a complete response and 45.3% of 106 patients achieved a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 53.8% (95% CI=34.8-63.5) (PMID: 28882436). In the follow-up Phase III trial (ARIEL3) of rucaparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with previously treated, platinum-sensitive HGOC harboring deleterious germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, median progression-free survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.4-22.9) in the rucaparib arm versus 5.4 months (95% CI 3.4-6.7) in the placebo arm (HR=0.23, p=0.0001) (PMID: 28916367). Post-progression endpoints from ARIEL3 demonstrated favorability of maintenance rucaparib versus placebo for the chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent therapy, time to second subsequent therapy, and progression on subsequent therapy or death (PMID: 32359490). Resistance to rucaparib is often through de novo or acquired BRCA reversion mutation, which decreases the clinical efficacy of rucaparib (PMID: 30425037). The NCCN v5.2022 lists rucaparib as a maintenance therapy for patients with BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer."

FDA approval was based on the Phase III NOVA trial of niraparib versus placebo in patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer with or without BRCA1/2 mutations in which patients in the germline BRCA mutant cohort (n=203) experienced significantly longer progression-free survival with niraparib than those in the placebo group (21.0 vs. 5.5 months; HR=0.27; 95% CI = 0.17-0.41) (PMID: 27717299). FDA approval of niraparib in the non-germline BRCA mutant patient cohort (n=350) was based on the results of improved progression-free survival with niraparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy (9.3 months vs. 3.9 months; HR=0.45; 95% CI= 0.34-0.61) in the overall non-germline BRCA cohort. However, the overall non-germline BRCA cohort included patients with somatic BRCA mutation (PMID: 27717299). Further studies have shown the efficacy of niraparib in patients with homologous-recombination-deficient, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, including patients with BRCA mutation (PMID: 30948273, 31562799). The NCCN v5.2022 lists niraparib as a maintenance therapy for patients with BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer."
