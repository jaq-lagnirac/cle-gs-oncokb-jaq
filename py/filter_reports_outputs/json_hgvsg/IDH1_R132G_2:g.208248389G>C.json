This mutation has been found in acute myeloid leukemia and gliomas, among others (PMID: 19935646, 29860938). In vitro studies have shown that this mutation leads to a switch in IDH1 enzymatic activity, allowing for the conversion of \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG) to the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) (PMID: 19935646, 23264629). IDH1 mutations at the R132 residue, including R132G, are sensitive to inhibition by AG-120 (Ivosidenib), a small-molecule inhibitor of mutant IDH1, as measured by a decrease in 2-HG level, an increase in the proportion of mature myeloid cells and increased levels of cell surface differentiation markers in treated cells compared to untreated cells (PMID: 29670690). A Phase I clinical trial for ivosidenib involving 268 patients with relapsed or refractory AML harboring IDH1 R132 mutations, including 18 with IDH1 R132G mutation, achieved an overall response rate of 41.6% and a reduction in the percentage of bone marrow blasts in treated patients (PMID: 29860938).",
