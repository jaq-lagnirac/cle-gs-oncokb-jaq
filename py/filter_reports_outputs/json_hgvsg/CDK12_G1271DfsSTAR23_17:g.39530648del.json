    "description":"CDK12 truncating mutations result in loss of protein function, resulting in defects in DNA repair pathways and consequent genomic instability (PMID: 25712099). Knockdown of CDK12 by siRNA expression in ovarian cancer cell lines markedly reduced BRCA1 expression and disrupted homologous recombination repair (PMID: 24554720). Additionally, CDK12 truncating mutations were shown to disrupt the interaction between CDK12 and cyclin K as compared to wildtype, leading to downregulation of genes involved in the homologous repair pathway (PMID: 25712099, 21720365). In patients with ovarian cancer, CDK12 inactivation was associated with increased genome instability and the presence of numerous tandem duplications (PMID: 26787825).",
