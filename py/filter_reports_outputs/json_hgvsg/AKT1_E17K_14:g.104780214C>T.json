    "description":"The AKT1 E17K mutation is located in the pleckstrin homology domain of the protein (PMID: 17611497, 20440266). This mutation has been found in the tissue overgrowth condition Proteus syndrome and in breast cancer (PMID: 21793738, 28489509). Expression of this mutation in breast cancer cells, murine fibroblasts, B cells, and in a mouse model of leukemia demonstrated that it is activating as measured by increased pathway activation, growth factor-independent cell proliferation, colony formation and tumor formation in vivo compared to wildtype (PMID: 17611497, 18256540, 9843996, 23134728, 23741320). In vitro studies have demonstrated that this mutation is sensitive to ATP competitive AKT inhibitors when expressed in an embryonic kidney cell line as measured by cell proliferation (PMID: 17611497). Fifty-two patients with solid tumors harboring this mutation demonstrated a clinical response to the AKT inhibitor AZD5363 (PMID: 28489509). In a study by the AACR GENIE consortium comparing outcomes of patients with E17K-mutant breast cancer to those who were AKT1-wildtype, there was no significant difference in overall survival, but patients harboring E17K alterations had longer duration on mTOR inhibitor therapy (PMID: 31924700).",

In a Phase I basket study of AZD5363 in AKT E17K-mutated cancers, AZD5363 treatment induced target lesion regression in fifteen of twenty evaluable patients with breast cancer, including four RECIST partial responses, with a median progression-free survival of 5.5 months (PMID: 28489509). In a second Phase I study of 41 patients with solid tumors in Japan, two patients with the AKT E17K mutation, one having breast cancer and the other having ovarian cancer, had partial responses to AZD5363 (PMID: 26351323). In vitro studies of breast cancer explants harboring the AKT E17K mutation have shown that AZD5363 inhibits tumor growth and reduces signaling downstream of AKT, including reduced phosphorylation of PRAS40 and S6 (PMID: 22294718).",
