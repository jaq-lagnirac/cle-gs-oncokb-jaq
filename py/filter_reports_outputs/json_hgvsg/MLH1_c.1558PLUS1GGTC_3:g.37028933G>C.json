    "description":"Truncating mutations in MLH1 result in premature codons and are associated with loss of MLH1 expression, preventing the protein's ability to bind PMS2 (PMID: 15713769, 16216036, 24362816). Loss of this interaction affects the ability of PMS2 to bind to DNA during damage resulting in impairment of endonuclease function during DNA mismatch repair (PMID: 7892206, 11781295, 12697830). Mice deficient in MLH1 spontaneously develop gastrointestinal tumors (GITs) and thymic lymphomas. The types of GITs include well-differentiated and also poorly differentiated and mucinous adenocarcinomas. Furthermore, GIT formation is further promoted by radiation exposure (PMID: 16623753). The intestinal tumors that develop in the MLH1 deficient mice exhibit increased mutation burden consistent with inactivation of mismatch repair (PMID: 10359802). Lymphoid tumors developed in MLH1 deficient mice also exhibit increased mutational burden with IKAROS, a master transcription factor of lymphoid lineage commitment and differentiation, being identified as a key mutational target (PMID: 17086208).",
