    "description":"RB1 truncating mutations produce several forms of C-terminally truncated RB1 proteins. These mutations have been found as germline mutations in familial retinoblastoma (PMID: 14769601). Loss of RB1 in an osteosarcoma cell line resulted in increased genome instability, DNA damage and tumor growth in a xenograft model compared to wildtype (PMID: 31138663). Loss of RB1 in germinal center B-cells of an in-vivo mouse model induced hyperproliferation of splenic B cells that eventually resulted in increased cell death compared to wildtype (PMID: 26607597). Six patients with ER+HER2- advanced breast cancer harboring RB1 mutation, out of a study of 127 patients, demonstrated resistance to the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in combination with the ESR1 inhibitor fulvestrant (PMID: 30206110). Truncating mutations of RB1 often predispose patients who have been successfully treated for hereditary retinoblastoma to secondary malignancies (PMID: 22205104).",
