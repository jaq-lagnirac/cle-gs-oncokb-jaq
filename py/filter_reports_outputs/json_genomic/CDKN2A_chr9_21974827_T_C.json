    "description":"CDKN2A truncating mutations form several forms of C-terminally truncated CDKN2A proteins. These mutations have been found in germline mutations in families with squamous cell cancer of the oral cavity (Abstract: Fostira et al. JCO PO, 2018. http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/PO.18.00022). Expression of a truncation mutation in vitro demonstrated that it was inactivating as measured by decreased binding to CDK4 and CDK6 and failure to inhibit the cell cycle compared to wildtype (PMID: 8668202). Additionally, expression of several C-terminally truncated CDKN2A proteins demonstrated that truncations upstream of residue 131 were inactivating as measured by decreased binding to CDK4 (PMID: 8603820).",
