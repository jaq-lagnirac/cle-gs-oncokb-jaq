    "description":"The PIK3CA H1047R mutation is located in the kinase domain in exon 21 of the protein (PMID: 16341083,17376864, 22120714). This mutation has been found in various cancers, including breast, head and neck, lung, colorectal and endometrial cancers (PMID: 27126994, 25631445, 23787421, 25079552, 22960745, 22941189, 17376864, 23636398). Expression of this mutation in chicken embryonic fibroblasts, Ba/F3 cells and MCF10A breast cells and in a transgenic mouse model demonstrated that it is activating as measured by increased kinase activity, downstream pathway activation, cytokine- and factor-independent proliferation, colony growth in soft agar, invasion and in vivo glioblastoma tumor burden compared to wildtype PIK3CA (PMID: 17376864, 26627007, 16432179, 16322248, 31996845). Genetically engineered mouse models have shown that the PIK3CA H1047R mutation promotes tumor formation in breast, colon, ovarian and lung cancer and malignant mesothelioma (PMID: 22370636, 23940356, 22214849, 21822287, 21324922, 19029981, 31911549). Mutations at this position are predicted to constitutively activate the catalytic subunit of PI3K (p110\u03b1) by exposing the catalytic loop towards the plasma membrane where its substrate, PIP2, is found (PMID: 17376864, 20593314). Patients with breast cancer harboring this mutation achieved partial response (n=2) or stable disease (n=1) following treatment with the PI3K\u03b1 inhibitor, alpelisib (PMID: 27126994). In a phase III trial of palbociclib/fulvestrant for ER+, HER2\u2212 advanced breast cancer that had previously progressed on endocrine therapy, patients with PIK3CA alterations, including the H1074R mutation, were found at a significantly higher percentage in end-of-treatment samples as compared to pre-treatment samples, suggesting that this mutation may play a role in resistance to fulvestrant (PMID: 30206110). Preclinical studies with mice expressing PIK3CA H1047R demonstrated sensitivity to treatment with RLY-2608 as measured by reduced tumor volume following treatment (Abstract: Varkaris et al.

FDA approval is based on data from the Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled SOLAR-1 trial of alpelisib plus fulvestrant versus placebo plus fulvestrant in 572 patients with breast cancer in which the progression-free survival in patients with PIK3CA mutation (n=341) was eleven months (95% CI= 7.5-14.5) with alpelisib plus fulvestrant versus 5.7 months (95% CI= 3.7-7.4) with placebo plus fulvestrant (HR= 0.65; 95% CI= 0.5-0.85; p= 0.0013) compared to PIK3CA-wildtype patients in which the hazard ratio was 0.85 (95% CI= 0.58-1.25) (PMID: 31091374). Overall response in the PIK3CA-mutant population was 35.7 months (95% CI= 27.4-44.7; n=126) with alpelisib plus fulvestrant versus 16.2 months (95% CI= 10.4-23.5; n=136) with placebo plus fulvestrant (PMID: 31091374). Previous studies, including in vivo xenograft studies and a phase I trial, also demonstrated that treatment of ER+ PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer with the combination of fulvestrant and alpelisib results in greater tumor shrinkage than either drug alone, with fulvestrant inhibiting the induction of ER-dependent gene transcription resulting from PI3K\u03b1 inhibition with alpelisib (PMID: 25877889, 30543347).",
