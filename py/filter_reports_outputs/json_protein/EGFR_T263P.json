This mutation has been found in multiple glioblastoma samples (PMID: 17177598). Cell line experiments demonstrate that this mutation is activating, transforming, and sensitive to erlotinib treatment (PMID: 17177598). The FDA-approved EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib was demonstrated to induce dose-dependent cell death in cells engineered to express this mutation compared to wildtype EGFR (PMID: 17177598).",

      "description":"Lapatinib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of ERBB2 and EGFR. Several in vitro studies have demonstrated the sensitivity of EGFR-altered cells to treatment with lapatinib. Expression of EGFR mutations, including A289V and T263P, in glioma cell lines demonstrated that they are sensitive to lapatinib as measured by increased apoptosis and decreased pathway activation upon drug treatment. Other EGFR alterations in lung and endometrial cells, including amplification or increased expression, have also demonstrated sensitivity to lapatinib treatment as measured by decreased proliferation and pathway activation (PMID: 22588883, 20459769, 18334972).",
