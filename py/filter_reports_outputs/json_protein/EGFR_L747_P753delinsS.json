    "description":"The EGFR exon 19 L747_P753delinsS alteration occurs in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain (PMID: 19147750). In-frame deletions of EGFR exon 19 result in constitutive activation of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity and confer sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) including gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib in lung adenocarcinoma (PMID: 15118073, 15118125, 15329413) and this is true of L747_P753delinsS which is found to be activating, transformating and sensitizing to EGFR TKIs (PMID: 19147750, 15118073). Across five clinical studies, eight patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring the EGFR L747_P753delinsS mutation derived clinical benefit from treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib, with six patients having a partial response, one patient having stable disease, and one patient exhibiting tumor marker decrease (PMID: 18508816, 15897572, 25179728, 15710947, 15118073).",

Additionally, in the biomarker analysis and final overall survival (OS) analysis of the Phase III IPASS study, though OS was not different between the gefitinib and carboplatin/paclitaxel groups, 64.3% of patients assigned to chemotherapy had crossed over to treatment with EGFR TKIs; PFS in this study was significantly longer with gefitinib than chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutation (HR=0.48) (PMID: 21670455). In a Phase II trial, the addition of carboplatin plus pemetrexed to gefitinib increased progression-free survival (20.9 months vs 11.9 months; HR = 0.490, P < .001) in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC compared to gefitinib alone (PMID: 31682542).",

FDA recommendation is based on the results of the double-blind Phase III FLAURA trial of osimertinib versus standard TKI (gefitinib or erlotinib) in 556 patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion- or L858R mutation-positive NSCLC in which the median progression-free survival (18.9 months vs. 10.2 months; HR = 0.46; 95% C=0.37-0.57) and the median duration of response (17.2 months vs. 8.5 months) were longer in the osimertinib arm than the standard TKI arm (PMID: 29151359). Overall survival data was immature at interim analysis (PMID: 29151359), but a study of post-progression endpoints demonstrated consistently favorable outcomes with osimertinib compared to gefitinib or erlotinib (PMID: 30659024).
