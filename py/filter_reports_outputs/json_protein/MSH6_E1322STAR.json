    "description":"Truncating mutations of MSH6 have been identified in patients with inherited Lynch syndrome and introduces a premature stop codon which leads to C-terminally truncated forms of the protein, including loss of part or all of the highly conserved MutS domain. Deletion of all or part of this domain causes a loss of ATPase activity, which can lead to impairment of DNA binding and mismatch repair (PMID: 1651234, 9111312, 9822680, 9564049, 24362816). Truncating MSH6 mutations are associated with a defect in mismatch repair (dMMR) and are typically accompanied by microsatellite instability (MSI) and hypermutation in colorectal and endometrial cancers (PMID: 22810696, 24755471).",
