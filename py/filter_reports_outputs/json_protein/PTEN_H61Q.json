In a different Phase I trial of GSK2636771 plus enzalutamide in 36 patients with PTEN-deficient metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, the 12-week non-progressive disease rate was 50% (95% CI: 28.2\u201371.8, n = 22) in patients receiving 200mg of GSK2636771 daily, with 1 (3%) patient achieving a radiographic partial response lasting 36 weeks (PMID: 34281912). In a Phase I clinical trial of AZD8186 in 87 patients with advanced solid tumors, partial responses were seen in one patient with castration-resistant prostate cancer who was also treated in combination with vistusertib, a dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor, and in another patient with PTEN-deficient colorectal cancer (Abstract: Hansen et al.
