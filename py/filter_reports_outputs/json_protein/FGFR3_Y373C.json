Expression of this mutation in murine fibroblast and bladder cell lines demonstrated that it is activating as measured by increased protein activation, colony formation and tumor formation in a xenograft model compared to wildtype (PMID: 16338952, 11429702, 19749790). In the Phase II FIGHT-207 trial examining pemigatinib treatment with patients harboring FGFR3 Y373C, three patients with bladder cancer demonstrated progressive disease, stable disease and partial response with a progression-free survival of 3 months, 5 months and 10 months, respectively (Abstract: Rodon et al.
