Furthermore, reduction of RAD51B levels also leads to genome instability, as evidenced by increased levels of chromosomal aberrations, increased aneuploidy and centrosome fragmentation in the mutant compared to wildtype (PMID: 16778173).",

FDA approval was based on the results of the Phase III PROfound trial of olaparib in adult patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had disease progression while receiving a new hormonal agent and who had a deleterious or suspected deleterious mutation in a homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene.
