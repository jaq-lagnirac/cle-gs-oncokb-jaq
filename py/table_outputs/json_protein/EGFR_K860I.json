    "description":"The EGFR exon 21 K860I mutation is located in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain. This mutation has not been functionally characterized. However, it has been observed to co-occur with known oncogenic EGFR mutations, including L861Q and L858R, in non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 19060236). Three lung adenocarcinoma patients with K860I mutations that co-occurred with other TKI-sensitive alterations (e.g., L858R, L861Q) responded to gefitinib therapy with partial response or stable disease, respectively (PMID: 19060236, 19536777).",
