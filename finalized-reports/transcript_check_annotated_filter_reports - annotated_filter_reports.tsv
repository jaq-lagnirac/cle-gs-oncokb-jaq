TRUE	0.14	Truncating APC mutations result in loss of full-length APC protein leading to impaired or abnormal APC function. APC deregulation is associated with accumulation of β-catenin, an oncogenic transcription factor, which in turn leads to aberrant target gene expression and tumorigenesis (PMID: 11062151). APC truncating mutations are typically early events occurring on a single allele (germline or somatic); however, the tumor often acquires a second hit on the second allele, reducing the overall amount of functional APC in the cell (PMID: 11257105). Furthermore, expression of truncating mutations of APC has been shown to result in chromosomal instability in a dominant manner, postulated to play an important role in the accumulation of additional oncogenic alterations (PMID: 15561772).

These mutations have been identified in glioma (PMID: 24117486, 22072542, 21817013, 24086756). CIC mutations were detected with chromosome 1p/19q co-deletion in a study examining patient oligodendrogliomas (PMID: 22588899). Oligodendrogliomas with loss of CIC detected with FUBP1 mutations were found to exclusively co-occur with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations (PMID: 22588899).

TRUE	0.123	The PTEN T277A mutation is located between the C2 and phosphatase domains of the protein. This mutation is located at a statistically significant hotspot (PMID: 26619011) There is conflicting functional data for this mutation. Expression of this mutation in vitro demonstrated that it was likely neutral as measured by no change in protein phosphatase activity compared to wildtype. However, expression of this mutation in isolated glioma cells demonstrated that it was inactivating as measured by protein mislocalization and increased downstream pathway activation compared to wildtype (PMID: 28263967).

This mutation has been found in breast and colon cancer and glioblastoma (PMID: 17376864, 31996845). Expression of this mutation in chicken embryonic fibroblasts, Ba/F3 cells, MCF10A breast cells and in a transgenic mouse model demonstrated that it is activating as measured by increased kinase activity, downstream pathway activation, factor-independent proliferation, anchorage-independent colony formation, in vivo tumor growth in xenograft models, and in vivo glioblastoma formation compared to wildtype PIK3CA (PMID: 17376864, 26627007, 16432179, 16322248, 31996845). Mutations at this position are predicted to abrogate p85-mediated inhibition of catalytic activity, thus likely resulting in constitutive activation of PIK3CA enzymatic activity (PMID: 20593314). In a phase III trial for ER+, HER2− advanced breast cancer that had previously progressed on endocrine therapy, patients were given either palbociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) plus fulvestrant (ESR1 antagonist) or placebo plus fulvestrant. PIK3CA alterations, including the E545K mutation, were found at a significantly higher percentage in end-of-treatment samples as compared to pre-treatment samples in patients from both treatment arms, suggesting that PIK3CA alterations may play a role in resistance to fulvestrant (PMID: 30206110). Expression of this mutation in a patient-derived xenograft model of lung squamous cell carcinoma demonstrated that it was sensitive to the pan-PIK3CA inhibitor BKM120 and the PIK3CAalpha-specific inhibitor BYL719 compared to PDX models expressing wildtype PIK3CA (PMID: 30093452).

Loss of SMARCB1 in MRTs can lead to activation of the Hedgehog pathway via aberrant activation of GLI1, a direct protein interactor of SMARCB1 (PMID:21076395). SMARCB1 loss was also shown to activate the downstream Wnt/Beta-catenin pathway and is important in hepatocyte differentiation. (PMID:23435428,). SMARCB1-mutant MRT xenografts in mice have also been shown to be sensitive to EZH2 inhibition, suggesting that these tumors may be dependent on EZH2 enzymatic activity (PMID:23620515). Reintroduction of SMARCB1 protein in SMARCB1-deleted MRT cell lines resulted in growth arrest through histone-deacetylase(HDAC)-dependent down-regulation of cyclin-D1, demonstrating another mechanism by which this tumor suppressor functions (PMID:12138206, 30755442).

This mutation has been found in leukemia and in colorectal and lung cancer (PMID: 28572459). Expression of this mutation in various cell lines demonstrated that it is activating, as measured by increased protein stability, increased protein activation, and increased pathway activation compared to wildtype (PMID: 19075190, 20147967, 20570890, 2403644). In vitro studies have demonstrated that this mutation confers resistance to BRAF inhibition in lymphoid cells as measured by decreased pathway activation in the presence of the drug, but is sensitive to the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib (PMID: 30341394). A patient with hairy cell leukemia acquired a KRAS G12D mutation following relapse on the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib but was successfully treated with the cobimetinib for at least 12 months (PMID: 30341394).

Human breast cancer cell lines that contain a truncating mutation in BRCA1 display elevated levels of aneuploidy and impaired DNA damage response. In addition, truncating mutations have been shown to induce aberrant protein localization, which may impact the interaction of important binding partners (PMID: 20608970). Mouse models of BRCA1 truncating mutations develop cancer, including mammary carcinomas, lymphomas and ovarian carcinomas (PMID: 11358863, 12483515, 12947386).
