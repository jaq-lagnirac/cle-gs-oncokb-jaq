True	0.158	Truncating mutations of BRCA2 can produce several forms of C-terminally truncated BRCA2 proteins. Protein domains that are deleted in BRCA2 truncating mutations include the C-terminal DNA binding domain, the nuclear localization signal and the CDK2 phosphorylation site, the latter which binds RAD51 (PMID: 20878484, 24312913). Experimental studies have shown that truncating mutations impair nuclear localization of BRCA2, essential for normal BRCA2 function (PMID: 10570174). BRCA2 is essential for maintaining the integrity of homologous recombination during DNA damage response (PMID: 11239455). Inactivating or truncating mutations of this gene are associated with a significant increase in lifetime risk for the development of breast, ovarian, prostate or pancreatic cancers (PMID: 22193408).

True	0.131	The ERBB2 R678Q mutation is located in the juxtamembrane domain of the protein and is a hotspot residue. This mutation has been found in various cancers including biliary, breast, and lung, among others (PMID: 23220880, 30449325). There is conflicting functional data for this mutation. Expression of this mutation in breast, bladder cancer and murine fibroblast cell lines demonstrated that it is activating as measured by increased protein and pathway activation, growth-factor independent cell proliferation, and colony formation compared to wildtype (PMID: 24971884, 30449325). However, expression of this mutation in breast and murine fibroblast and B-cell cell lines demonstrate that it is neutral as measured by no change in protein activity, cell proliferation or colony formation compared to wildtype (PMID: 23220880, 29967253). In vitro studies have demonstrated that this mutation is sensitive to the ERBB2 inhibitors trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatinib, afatinib, sapitinib, osimertinib and neratinib when expressed in a murine fibroblast cell line as measured by moderately decreased cell proliferation upon drug treatment (PMID: 23220880, 29967253, 30449325). Two patients with colorectal and gastroesophageal cancer harboring this mutation had progressive disease upon treatment with neratinib, and a patient with endometrial cancer harboring this mutation had stable disease (5.5 months) upon treatment with neratinib in a neratinib basket trial (PMID: 29420467).

Human breast cancer cell lines that contain a truncating mutation in BRCA1 display elevated levels of aneuploidy and impaired DNA damage response. In addition, truncating mutations have been shown to induce aberrant protein localization, which may impact the interaction of important binding partners (PMID: 20608970). Mouse models of BRCA1 truncating mutations develop cancer, including mammary carcinomas, lymphomas and ovarian carcinomas (PMID: 11358863, 12483515, 12947386).
