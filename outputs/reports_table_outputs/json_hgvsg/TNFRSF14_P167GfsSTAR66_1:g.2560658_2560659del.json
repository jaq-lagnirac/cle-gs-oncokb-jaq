    "description":"Truncating mutations in TNFRSF14 can occur throughout the entire gene and are predicted to lead to loss of its activity (PMID: 27257180, 29625055). TNFRSF14 encodes a Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) receptor superfamily member that has been shown to be involved in signal transduction pathways that regulate inflammatory and T-cell immune responses (PMID: 27982078, 21402741, 11742858). This gene has also been known for its role in mediating herpes virus entry into cells (PMID: 22017438, 24307582). TNFRSF14 aberrations have been associated with worse prognosis in follicular lymphoma, and they also seem to increase the susceptibility to allogeneic T-cells received during bone marrow transplantation (PMID:20884631, 27103745). Reduced expression of this protein has been reported in follicular (PMID: 27257180), marginal zone (PMID: 27297871) and Hodgkin (PMID: 26650888) lymphomas, and this gene has also been shown to act as a tumor suppressor in bladder carcinomas by promoting apoptosis (PMID: 30066919). Additionally, truncating mutations in TNFRSF14 have been identified in exome-sequencing studies in other malignancies (PMID: 29625055)",
