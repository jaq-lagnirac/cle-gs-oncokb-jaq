In a phase II, open-label, single-arm study of poziotinib in 39 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutations who developed acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs, three of 39 (8%; 95% CI= 2-21) and seventeen of 39 (44%; 95% CI=28-60) patients had partial responses and stable disease, respectively, and the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival was 2.7 months (95% CI=1.8 to 3.7) and 15.0 months (95% CI=9.5 to not estimable), respectively (PMID: 27188206). In a single center, phase II, open-label study of poziotinib in 50 patients with advanced NSCLC with point mutations or insertions in EGFR exon 20, overall response rates for patients overall, patients with near-loop mutations and patients with far-loop mutations were 32.0% (95% CI= 20.7 to 45.8, n = 16), 46% and 0%, respectively( PMID: 35820397).  Additionally, the disease control rate was 84.0% (95% CI= 71.5 to 92.0) and the median PFS and overall survival were 5.5 months (95% CI= 5.4 to 10.4) and 19.2 months (95% CI= 11.8 to 24.1) in these populations, respectively (PMID: 35820397). In vitro, poziotinib was shown to be approximately 40 times more potent than afatinib and 65 times more potent than dacomitinib at inhibiting growth in Ba/F3 cell lines bearing different EGFR exon 20 insertions (PMID: 29686424). In genetically engineered mouse models and xenograft models harboring an EGFR exon 20 insertion, poziotinib resulted in 80% tumor reduction in four weeks and 50% tumor reduction in ten days, whereas afatinib did not reduce tumor burden in either model (PMID: 29686424).
