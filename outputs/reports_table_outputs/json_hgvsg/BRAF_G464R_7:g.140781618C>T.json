Expression of this mutation in NIH-3T3 cells demonstrated that this mutation is activating as measured by increased downstream pathway activation compared to wildtype BRAF, though to a lesser extent than BRAF V600E (PMID: 15046639). In vitro studies with Ba/F3 and MCF10A cells expressing BRAF G464R demonstrate that the mutation is activating as measured by increased cell viability and proliferation compared to wildtype (PMID: 29533785). In a case report for a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer harboring BRAF G464R and KRAS G12S, the patient was treated with bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI and then later treated with bevacizumab plus FOLFOXIRI and demonstrated recurrent disease in the sigmoid colon following both treatment regimens (PMID: 31183211).",
