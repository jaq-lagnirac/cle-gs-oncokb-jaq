In vitro studies demonstrated that the mutant exhibits reduced phosphorylation of AMPK, a known target of STK11 (PMID: 26917230). In vitro studies with HEK293 cells expressing STK11 D194Y demonstrate that the mutation is inactivating as measured by loss of kinase activity and decreased TP53-mediated transcriptional activity compared to wildtype (PMID: 34849607).",

In a phase II trial of bemcentinib + pembrolizumab in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), three evaluable patients with STK11 mutations demonstrated objective clinical response/clinical benefit. Additionally, preclinical data shows that AXL inhibition increases the efficacy of checkpoint blockade in STK11-deficient tumor models (Abstract: Li et al.
