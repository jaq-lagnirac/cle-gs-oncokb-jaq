FDA approval was based on the results of the Phase III PROfound trial of olaparib in adult patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had disease progression while receiving a new hormonal agent and who had a deleterious or suspected deleterious mutation in a homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene. Of patients with a qualifying alteration in an HRR gene, the progression-free survival in the olaparib group was 5.8 months compared to 3.5 months in the placebo group (HR=0.49; 95% CI= 0.38 to 0.63; p<0.001), with a median overall survival of 17.5 months versus 14.3 months (0.67; 95% CI= 0.49 to 0.93) and an overall response rate of 22% versus 4%, respectively (PMID: 32343890).
