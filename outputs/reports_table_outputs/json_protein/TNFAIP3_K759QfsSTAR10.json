    "description":"Truncating mutations in TNFAIP3 can occur throughout the entire gene and have been shown to lead to impairment of its inhibitory activity on the NF-\u03baB pathway (PMID: 27479826). TNFAIP3 encodes a Zn-finger protein and ubiquitin-editing enzyme that has been shown to be involved in immune response regulation (PMID: 29515565, 31030956). TNFAIP3 has been shown to negatively regulate several cytokine-mediated signaling cascades by terminating NF-kappa B activity (PMID: 28469620, 26642243). Germline truncating mutations in TNFAIP3 have been shown to lead haploinsufficiency manifested by early-onset autoimmune disease phenotype in the affected families (PMID: 26642243). Truncating mutations in TNFAIP3, leading to loss of this protein, have been identified in patients with diffuse large B-cell and marginal zone lymphomas, as well as several carcinomas (PMID: 19258598, 29625055).",
