    "description":"The POLE V411L mutation is located in a conserved residue in the exonuclease domain of the protein. This mutation is recurrent in colorectal and endometrial carcinoma and is associated with hypermutation (PMID: 23636398). Expression of this mutation in cell lines demonstrates that it is likey inactivating as measured by increased numbers of point mutations in DNA proofreading experiments in vitro (PMID: 25228659). A patient with colorectal cancer harboring the POLE V411L mutation had a durable complete response to treatment with pembrolizumab (Abstract: Silberman et al. JCO PO, 2019. https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/PO.18.00214).",
