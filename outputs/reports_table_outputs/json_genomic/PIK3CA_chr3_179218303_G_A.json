    "description":"The PIK3CA E545K mutation is located in the helical domain in exon 10 of the protein. This mutation has been found in breast and colon cancer and glioblastoma (PMID: 17376864, 31996845). Expression of this mutation in chicken embryonic fibroblasts, Ba/F3 cells, MCF10A breast cells and in a transgenic mouse model demonstrated that it is activating as measured by increased kinase activity, downstream pathway activation, factor-independent proliferation, anchorage-independent colony formation, in vivo tumor growth in xenograft models, and in vivo glioblastoma formation compared to wildtype PIK3CA (PMID: 17376864, 26627007, 16432179, 16322248, 31996845). Mutations at this position are predicted to abrogate p85-mediated inhibition of catalytic activity, thus likely resulting in constitutive activation of PIK3CA enzymatic activity (PMID: 20593314). In a phase III trial for ER+, HER2\u2212 advanced breast cancer that had previously progressed on endocrine therapy, patients were given either palbociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) plus fulvestrant (ESR1 antagonist) or placebo plus fulvestrant. PIK3CA alterations, including the E545K mutation, were found at a significantly higher percentage in end-of-treatment samples as compared to pre-treatment samples in patients from both treatment arms, suggesting that PIK3CA alterations may play a role in resistance to fulvestrant (PMID: 30206110). Expression of this mutation in a patient-derived xenograft model of lung squamous cell carcinoma demonstrated that it was sensitive to the pan-PIK3CA inhibitor BKM120 and the PIK3CAalpha-specific inhibitor BYL719 compared to PDX models expressing wildtype PIK3CA (PMID: 30093452). Preclinical studies with mice expressing PIK3CA E545K demonstrated sensitivity to treatment with RLY-2608 as measured by reduced tumor volume following treatment (Abstract: Varkaris et al.

      "description":"Alpelisib is a selective inhibitor of the alpha form of PI3K (PI3K\u03b1) that is FDA-approved in combination with the selective estrogen receptor (ER) degrader fulvestrant for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with ER+ HER2- PIK3CA-mutated, advanced or metastatic breast cancer. FDA approval is based on data from the Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled SOLAR-1 trial of alpelisib plus fulvestrant versus placebo plus fulvestrant in 572 patients with breast cancer in which the progression-free survival in patients with PIK3CA mutation (n=341) was eleven months (95% CI= 7.5-14.5) with alpelisib plus fulvestrant versus 5.7 months (95% CI= 3.7-7.4) with placebo plus fulvestrant (HR= 0.65; 95% CI= 0.5-0.85; p= 0.0013) compared to PIK3CA-wildtype patients in which the hazard ratio was 0.85 (95% CI= 0.58-1.25) (PMID: 31091374). Overall response in the PIK3CA-mutant population was 35.7 months (95% CI= 27.4-44.7; n=126) with alpelisib plus fulvestrant versus 16.2 months (95% CI= 10.4-23.5; n=136) with placebo plus fulvestrant (PMID: 31091374). Previous studies, including in vivo xenograft studies and a phase I trial, also demonstrated that treatment of ER+ PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer with the combination of fulvestrant and alpelisib results in greater tumor shrinkage than either drug alone, with fulvestrant inhibiting the induction of ER-dependent gene transcription resulting from PI3K\u03b1 inhibition with alpelisib (PMID: 25877889, 30543347).",
