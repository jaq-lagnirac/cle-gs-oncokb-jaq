    "description":"Truncating mutations in PMS2 can produce several C-terminally truncated protein forms, affecting all or part the nuclease domain, thus eliminating the ability of PMS2 to incise the DNA flanking a mismatch. In addition, the loss of the MLH1 binding domain, which is found near the C-terminud of PMS2, causes PMS2 protein instability and inhibits the ability of PMS2 to heterodimerize, bind to damaged DNA and perform its endonuclease function (PMID: 7892206, 12697830). Truncating mutations are frequently detected in individuals with inherited Lynch syndrome, but also in constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome (PMID: 21376568, 20487569, 9488480, 16144131, 23582141, 24362816). Mouse modeling of PMS2 deletion results in the development of various cancers, including spontaneous thymic lymphoma and sarcoma. PMS2-deficient mice were also found to have increased sensitivity to chemical carcinogens (PMID:10439048). Tumors from PMS2-deficient mice have high microsatellite instability and have increased mutation accumulation (PMID: 7628019, 10874005, 9500552). Together, this data suggest that loss of PMS2 may contribute to tumor formation.",
