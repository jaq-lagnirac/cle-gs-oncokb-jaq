FDA approval was based on the results of the multicenter, open-label, multi-cohort LIBRETTO-001 trial (NCT03157128) of selpercatinib in 143 patients with advanced or metastatic RET-mutant MTC who had either been previously treated with cabozantinib and/or vandetanib (n = 55 patients) or were na\u00efve to cabozantinib and vandetanib (n = 88 patients). In this trial, the overall response rate was 69% (95% CI=55-81) in the previously treated cohort and 73% (95% CI= 62-82) in the treatment-na\u00efve cohort, with 76% and 61% of these cohorts having a duration of response greater than or equal to six months, respectively (Abstract: Wirth et al.
