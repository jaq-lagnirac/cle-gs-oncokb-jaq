True	0.137	The PIK3CA H1047R mutation is located in the kinase domain in exon 21 of the protein (PMID: 16341083,17376864, 22120714). This mutation has been found in various cancers, including breast, head and neck, lung, colorectal and endometrial cancers (PMID: 27126994, 25631445, 23787421, 25079552, 22960745, 22941189, 17376864, 23636398). Expression of this mutation in chicken embryonic fibroblasts, Ba/F3 cells and MCF10A breast cells and in a transgenic mouse model demonstrated that it is activating as measured by increased kinase activity, downstream pathway activation, cytokine- and factor-independent proliferation, colony growth in soft agar, invasion and in vivo glioblastoma tumor burden compared to wildtype PIK3CA (PMID: 17376864, 26627007, 16432179, 16322248, 31996845). Genetically engineered mouse models have shown that the PIK3CA H1047R mutation promotes tumor formation in breast, colon, ovarian and lung cancer and malignant mesothelioma (PMID: 22370636, 23940356, 22214849, 21822287, 21324922, 19029981, 31911549). Mutations at this position are predicted to constitutively activate the catalytic subunit of PI3K (p110α) by exposing the catalytic loop towards the plasma membrane where its substrate, PIP2, is found (PMID: 17376864, 20593314). Patients with breast cancer harboring this mutation achieved partial response (n=2) or stable disease (n=1) following treatment with the PI3Kα inhibitor, alpelisib (PMID: 27126994). In a phase III trial of palbociclib/fulvestrant for ER+, HER2− advanced breast cancer that had previously progressed on endocrine therapy, patients with PIK3CA alterations, including the H1074R mutation, were found at a significantly higher percentage in end-of-treatment samples as compared to pre-treatment samples, suggesting that this mutation may play a role in resistance to fulvestrant (PMID: 30206110). Preclinical studies with mice expressing PIK3CA H1047R demonstrated sensitivity to treatment with RLY-2608 as measured by reduced tumor volume following treatment (Abstract: Varkaris et al.

Mice deficient in MLH1 spontaneously develop gastrointestinal tumors (GITs) and thymic lymphomas. The types of GITs include well-differentiated and also poorly differentiated and mucinous adenocarcinomas. Furthermore, GIT formation is further promoted by radiation exposure (PMID: 16623753). The intestinal tumors that develop in the MLH1 deficient mice exhibit increased mutation burden consistent with inactivation of mismatch repair (PMID: 10359802). Lymphoid tumors developed in MLH1 deficient mice also exhibit increased mutational burden with IKAROS, a master transcription factor of lymphoid lineage commitment and differentiation, being identified as a key mutational target (PMID: 17086208).

Analysis of clinicopathologic features and outcome in patients with metastatic melanoma harboring activating BRAF mutations revealed that, compared to V600E, V600K mutation was significantly associated with male sex, older age (median age, head/neck primary tumor location, shorter interval to stage IV disease, and shorter overall survival from the time of diagnosis of stage IV disease (PMID: 23922205, 22535154). Comprehensive biological characterization of BRAF V600K mutation (PMID: 15035987, 26343582) has demonstrated that this mutation activates the downstream MAPK pathway independently of RAS (PMID: 19251651, 26343582), renders BRAF constitutively activated in monomeric form (PMID: 20179705) and retains sensitivity to RAF monomer inhibitors such as vemurafenib (PMID: 26343582, 28783719, 20179705). Preliminary studies suggest that BRAF V600K mutant tumors may not respond to combined BRAF and MEK inhibition as well as BRAF V600E tumors due to a decreased reliance on the MAPK pathway, though further studies are needed to validate this finding (PMID: 30630828).

Truncated ATRX variants in both alpha thalassaemia mental retardation (ATR-X) syndrome and alpha thalassemia myelodysplastic syndrome (ATMDS) are most commonly detected in the highly conserved helicase domain and also the P-box and Q-box domains, potential protein-interaction domains (PMID: 8968741, 14592816, 18409179, 17609377). In some cases, the truncated ATRX phenotype can be rescued by expression of a downstream start site through intraexonic skipping of the mutant allele, consistent with a hypomorphic effect (PMID: 18409179, 15591283). Based on loss of function studies, ATRX deletions are expected to result in chromosomal instability and alternate lengthening of telomeres (ALT) (PMID: 21719641, 24148618).
