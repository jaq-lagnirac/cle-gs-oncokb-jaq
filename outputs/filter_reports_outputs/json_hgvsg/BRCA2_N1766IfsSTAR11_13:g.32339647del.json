    "description":"Truncating mutations of BRCA2 can produce several forms of C-terminally truncated BRCA2 proteins. Protein domains that are deleted in BRCA2 truncating mutations include the C-terminal DNA binding domain, the nuclear localization signal and the CDK2 phosphorylation site, the latter which binds RAD51 (PMID: 20878484, 24312913). Experimental studies have shown that truncating mutations impair nuclear localization of BRCA2, essential for normal BRCA2 function (PMID: 10570174). BRCA2 is essential for maintaining the integrity of homologous recombination during DNA damage response (PMID: 11239455). Inactivating or truncating mutations of this gene are associated with a significant increase in lifetime risk for the development of breast, ovarian, prostate or pancreatic cancers (PMID: 22193408).",

      "description":"Olaparib, a small molecule PARP inhibitor, is FDA-approved with or without bevacizumab for the treatment of patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have deleterious germline BRCA mutations and have been treated with three or more lines of chemotherapy or as maintenance therapy for patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are having partial or complete responses to platinum-based chemotherapy. This drug is considered standard-of-care for the treatment of patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. Initial FDA approval was based on Phase I and Phase II clinical trials evaluating patients with ovarian cancer harboring known BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations, in which treatment with olaparib demonstrated a clear clinical benefit. Specifically, in a Phase II trial evaluating olaparib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and a confirmed germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (n=193), tumor response rate was 31% (95% CI=24.6 to 38.1), and stable disease (at 8 weeks) was seen in 40% of patients (95% CI=33.4 to 47.7) (PMID: 25366685). More recent FDA approval was based on a planned retrospective analysis of Phase II trial data in which patients with deleterious BRCA mutations had significantly longer progression-free survival with olaparib maintenance therapy than patients given placebo (11.2 months vs 4.3 months; HR=0.18; p=0\u00b70001)(PMID: 24882434).

      "description":"Olaparib, a small molecule PARP inhibitor, is FDA-approved with or without bevacizumab for the treatment of patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have deleterious germline BRCA mutations and have been treated with three or more lines of chemotherapy or as maintenance therapy for patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are having partial or complete responses to platinum-based chemotherapy. This drug is considered standard-of-care for the treatment of patients with somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. Initial FDA approval was based on Phase I and Phase II clinical trials evaluating patients with ovarian cancer harboring known BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations, in which treatment with olaparib demonstrated a clear clinical benefit. Specifically, in a Phase II trial evaluating olaparib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and a confirmed germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (n=193), tumor response rate was 31% (95% CI=24.6 to 38.1), and stable disease (at 8 weeks) was seen in 40% of patients (95% CI=33.4 to 47.7) (PMID: 25366685). More recent FDA approval was based on a planned retrospective analysis of Phase II trial data in which patients with deleterious BRCA mutations had significantly longer progression-free survival with olaparib maintenance therapy than patients given placebo (11.2 months vs 4.3 months; HR=0.18; p=0\u00b70001)(PMID: 24882434). The use of maintenance olaparib versus placebo increased progression-free survival, with a 70% lower risk of disease progression or death with olaparib (PMID: 30285518, 30345884)(Abstract: Penson et al.

      "description":"Niraparib, a small molecule PARP inhibitor, is FDA-approved as maintenance therapy for the treatment of adult patients with advanced ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who have been treated with three or more prior chemotherapy regimens and whose cancer is associated with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) positive status such as by harboring a deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCA mutation. FDA approval was based on the Phase III NOVA trial of niraparib versus placebo in patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer with or without BRCA1/2 mutations in which patients in the germline BRCA mutant cohort (n=203) experienced significantly longer progression-free survival with niraparib than those in the placebo group (21.0 vs. 5.5 months; HR=0.27; 95% CI = 0.17-0.41) (PMID: 27717299). FDA approval of niraparib in the non-germline BRCA mutant patient cohort (n=350) was based on the results of improved progression-free survival with niraparib versus placebo as maintenance therapy (9.3 months vs. 3.9 months; HR=0.45; 95% CI= 0.34-0.61) in the overall non-germline BRCA cohort. However, the overall non-germline BRCA cohort included patients with somatic BRCA mutation (PMID: 27717299). Further studies have shown the efficacy of niraparib in patients with homologous-recombination-deficient, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, including patients with BRCA mutation (PMID: 30948273, 31562799). The NCCN v5.2022 lists niraparib as a maintenance therapy for patients with BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer.",

      "description":"Talazoparib, a small molecule PARP inhibitor, is FDA-approved for patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. FDA approval was based on the results from the Phase III EMBRACA trial of talazoparib (1 mg once daily) versus standard single-agent chemotherapy (2:1) in 431 patients with advanced, BRCA1/2 germline-mutated breast cancer in which the median progression-free survival was 8.6 months in the talazoparib group versus 5.6 months in the chemotherapy group (HR= 0.54; 95%CI=0.41 to 0.71; p<0.001) and the objective response rate was 62.6% in the talazoparib group versus 27.2% in the chemotherapy group (p<0.001) (PMID: 30110579). In the Phase II study of talazoparib in patients with germline BRCA-mutant breast cancer who had a prior response to platinum agents, the overall response rate was 21-37% (depending on cohort) (PMID: 30563931). In a Phase I study of talazoparib plus carboplatin in patients with and without DNA repair mutations, three patients with somatic BRCA mutations had stable disease beyond four months (Abstract: Dhawan et al. Abstract# 2527, ASCO 2017. https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2017.35.15_suppl.2527). In the Phase IIb tumor-agnostic JAVELIN BRCA/ATM trial of combination talazoparib and avelumab in 159 patients with BRCA1/2-altered solid tumors, the objective response was observed in 42 patients (26.4%, 95% CI = 19.7%\u201334.0%) and the median duration of response was 10.9 months (95% CI = 6.2 months to not estimable) (PMID: 36394867).",
