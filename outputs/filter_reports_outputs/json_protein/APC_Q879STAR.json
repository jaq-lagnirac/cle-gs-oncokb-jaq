    "description":"Truncating APC mutations result in loss of full-length APC protein leading to impaired or abnormal APC function. APC deregulation is associated with accumulation of \u03b2-catenin, an oncogenic transcription factor, which in turn leads to aberrant target gene expression and tumorigenesis (PMID: 11062151). APC truncating mutations are typically early events occurring on a single allele (germline or somatic); however, the tumor often acquires a second hit on the second allele, reducing the overall amount of functional APC in the cell (PMID: 11257105). Furthermore, expression of truncating mutations of APC has been shown to result in chromosomal instability in a dominant manner, postulated to play an important role in the accumulation of additional oncogenic alterations (PMID: 15561772).",
