These mutations have been found in gastric, colon, breast, and pancreatic cancer (PMID: 22009941). Endogenous expression of these mutations in ovarian and endometrial cancer cell lines demonstrated that they are activating as measured by increased cell proliferation compared to the re-expression of wildtype, and in vivo loss of ARID1A in combination with a mutation in the PTEN-PIK3CA pathway resulted in the development of ovarian cancer in transgenic mouse models (PMID: 21900401, 24899687, 25625625).",

Small molecule inhibitors of the BET family of proteins have been shown to specifically inhibit proliferation of ARID1A-mutated cell lines, both in vitro and in ovarian clear cell cancer xenografts and patient-derived xenograft models (PMID: 29760405). Similarly, loss of ARID1A has been shown to sensitize breast cancer cells to BET inhibition with various BET inhibitors including JQ1, OTX015, and IBET762 (PMID: 31913353).",
