    "description":"Truncating mutations of NF2 can produce several forms of C-terminally truncated proteins, and result in loss of NF2 protein function. These alterations are predicted to cause activation of multiple mitogenic signaling pathways, including mTOR and Hippo signaling (PMID: 22825583), which has led to a study of mTOR inhibitors in patients or cell lines with NF2 mutations (PMID: 22825583). Truncating mutations are frequently observed in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and are associated with poor prognosis (PMID: 8755919, 9643284). Somatic truncating mutations are more commonly frameshift mutations, whereas germline mutations associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 are more commonly nonsense mutations (PMID: 19545378).",
