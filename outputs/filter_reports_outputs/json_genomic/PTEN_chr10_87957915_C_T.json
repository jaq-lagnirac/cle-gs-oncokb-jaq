Truncating mutations closer to the N-terminus result in loss of PTEN phosphatase function and an inability to negatively regulate PI3K/AKT pathway activity (PMID: 11237521). Expression of a PTEN truncation mutation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts demonstrated that these mutations are oncogenic and increase genome fragility due to the inability of PTEN to associate with chromosomal centromeres compared to the full-length protein (PMID: 17218262).",

In a different Phase I trial of GSK2636771 plus enzalutamide in 36 patients with PTEN-deficient metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, the 12-week non-progressive disease rate was 50% (95% CI: 28.2\u201371.8, n = 22) in patients receiving 200mg of GSK2636771 daily, with 1 (3%) patient achieving a radiographic partial response lasting 36 weeks (PMID: 34281912). In a Phase I clinical trial of AZD8186 in 87 patients with advanced solid tumors, partial responses were seen in one patient with castration-resistant prostate cancer who was also treated in combination with vistusertib, a dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor, and in another patient with PTEN-deficient colorectal cancer (Abstract: Hansen et al.
