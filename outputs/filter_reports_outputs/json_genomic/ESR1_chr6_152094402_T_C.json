In a retrospective analysis of the Phase III SoFEA trial of fulvestrant or exemestane in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, patients who had ER mutations had a significantly longer median progression-free survival when treated with fulvestrant (5.7 months) versus exemestane (2.6 months) (HR, 0.52; P = 0.02), while patients without ER mutations had no significant difference in median progression-free survival between the two treatment arms (P = 0.77) (PMID: 27269946). The addition of abemaciclib to fulvrestrant in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer further increased overall survival in these patients (PMID: 31563959). In the randomized, open-label Phase III PADA-1 trial of combination fulvestrant and palbociclib in 172 patients with estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer with rising ESR1 mutation in blood, median progression-free survival was 11.9 months (95% CI= 9.1-13.6) in the fulvestrant and palbociclib experimental group versus 5.7 months (95% CI= 3.9-7.5) in the aromatase inhibitor and palbociclib control group (PMID: 36183733).",
