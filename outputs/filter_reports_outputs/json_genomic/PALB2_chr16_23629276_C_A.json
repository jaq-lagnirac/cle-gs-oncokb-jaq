As such, PALB2 is considered a rare breast cancer susceptibility gene. In patient studies, PALB2 truncation mutations were shown to significantly increase the risk of breast cancer, with similar risks for estrogen receptor-positive and -negative breast cancer. PALB2 truncation mutations have also been found in cases of hereditary male breast cancer (PMID: 28858227, 18053174, 25529982, 29484706, 28279176, 28779002).",
