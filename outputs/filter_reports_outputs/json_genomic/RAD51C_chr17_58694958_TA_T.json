FDA approval was based on the results of the Phase III PROfound trial of olaparib in adult patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had disease progression while receiving a new hormonal agent and who had a deleterious or suspected deleterious mutation in a homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene.
