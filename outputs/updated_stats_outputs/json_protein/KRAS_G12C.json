Expression of this mutation in lung and breast cancer cell lines and mouse models demonstrated that it is activating, as measured by increased pathway activation, cell proliferation, colony formation and in vivo tumor formation compared to wildtype (PMID: 25705018, 26841430, 16051643, 32792368). In vitro studies of cells expressing the KRAS G12C mutation demonstrate that it is sensitive to several targeted therapies designed specifically for this allele, including ARS853 (PMID: 26841430, 24256730). In a phase I clinical trial of the KRAS G12C inhibitor AMG510 in which thirteen patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring this mutation were given the target drug dose, 100% of patients responded, with seven patients having partial response and six patients having stable disease (Abstract: Fakih et al.

      "description":"Trametinib, cobimetinib, and binimetinib are MEK1/2 kinase inhibitors that are NCCN-listed and FDA-approved for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations. In a multicenter, single-arm, open-label, phase IB trial (NCT02964689) of binimetinib in combination with cisplatin and pemetrexed in fourteen evaluable patients with stage III-IV NSCLC with KRAS (codon 12, 13 or 61) mutations, the overall response rate was 33% (95% CI=7\u201370) among the nine patients that received binimetinib, where three of nine patients had a partial response, two of nine had stable disease, three of nine had progressive disease, and one of nine was not assessable for response (PMID: 33933896). On average, in vitro studies have shown that trametinib inhibits the proliferation of KRAS mutant cancer cell lines (n = 50) with lower IC50s than other MEK inhibitors, including selumetinib (PMID: 24746704). Cobimetinib, which inhibits the kinase activity of MEK but allows the induction of RAF-dependent feedback phosphorylation of MEK, was demonstrated to be less effective in KRAS-mutant tumors than in BRAF-mutant tumors (PMID: 25435214, 23934108).",
