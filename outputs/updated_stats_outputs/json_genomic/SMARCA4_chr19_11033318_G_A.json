This mutation has been identified in Burkitt lymphoma and is a statistically significant hotspot (PMID: 31558468). In vitro studies with 293T cells expressing SMARCA4 R1192C demonstrate that the mutation is inactivating as measured by deficiency in chromatin opening and inducing gene expression compared to wildtype (PMID: 33144586).",
