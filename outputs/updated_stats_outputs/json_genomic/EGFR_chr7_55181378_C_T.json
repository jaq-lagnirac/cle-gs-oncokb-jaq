    "description":"The EGFR exon 20 T790M mutation occurs in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain and is considered a \"gatekeeper\" mutation. This mutation is found in non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 15737014). Studies show that this mutation is oncogenic and increases the affinity of EGFR for ATP (PMID: 18227510). EGFR T790M generally occurs as an acquired secondary mutation upon prolonged exposure to first- and second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as erlotinib, gefinitib or afatinib, and is recognized by the NCCN to confer clinical resistance to these inhibitors (PMID: 15728811, 15737014, 18227510). The third-generation EGFR TKI, osimertinib, is associated with clinical benefit in patients with the EGFR T790M mutation and is FDA-approved for patients with EGFR T790M-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 29151359). Preclinical models with EGFR exon 19 deletion and the T790M and L792H mutations show resistance to first-, second-, and third-generation EGFR inhibitors, and moderate sensitivity to PKC and ALK inhibitors (PMID: 34526717).",

      "description":"Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that inhibits T790M-mutant EGFR, is FDA-approved for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations, and for patients with EGFR T790M-mutant NSCLC who have progressed on other EGFR TKIs. FDA approval was based on the results of the Phase I AURA study of osimertinib in 127 patients with T790M mutation-positive NSCLC (PMID: 25923549) and the Phase II AURA2 study of osimertinib in 210 patients with T790M mutation-positive NSCLC (PMID: 27751847). In the Phase I dose-escalation and dose-expansion studies, the response rate was 61% (95% CI 52-70) among patients with T790M mutations, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 9.6 months (95% CI =8.3-NA) versus 2.8 months (95% CI=2.1-4.3) in patients without T790M mutations (PMID: 25923549). In the Phase II single-arm study of patients with T790M-positive NSCLC who progressed on previous EGFR TKI therapy, six of 199 patients (3%) achieved a complete response and 134 of 199 patients (67%) achieved a partial response, with a median PFS in the study of 9.9 months (95% CI=8.5-12.3) (PMID: 27751847). Since its FDA approval, a Phase II trial of osimertinib as a first-line therapy in patients with metastatic EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation-positive NSCLC showed significantly longer PFS with osimertinib versus erlotinib or gefitinib (18.9 months vs. 10.2 months; HR= 0.46; 95% CI 0.37-0.57; p=0.001) suggesting utility of osimertinib as a first-line TKI in patients with EGFR activating mutations (PMID: 29151359). Osimertinib was found to specifically have an effect on patients with NSCLC and central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Of the 419 patients in the phase III AURA trial, 116 patients had CNS lesions. Of those 116 patients, PFS was 11.7 months on osimertinib and 5.6 months on platinum-pemetrexed, and the overall response rate was 40% with osimertinib (30/75) and 17% with platinum-pemetrexed (7/41) (PMID: 30059262).",
