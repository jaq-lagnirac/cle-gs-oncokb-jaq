      "description":"Tipifarnib is a farnesyl protein transferase inhibitor. In a Phase II trial of tipifarnib in HRAS-mutant head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), ten of eighteen patients had a partial response, with progression-free survival in this cohort of 8.3 months (Abstract: Ho et al. Abstract# PR08, Molecular Cancer Therapeutics, 2019. https://mct.aacrjournals.org/content/18/12_Supplement/PR08). In a single-arm, open-label Phase II trial of tipifarnib in 22 patients with HNSCC with high mutant-HRAS variant allele frequency, the objective response rate was 55% (95% CI= 31.5 to 76.9), median overall survival was 15.4 months (95% CI= 7.0 to 29.7) and the median progression-free survival was 5.6 months (95% CI= 3.6 to 16.4) with tipifarnib versus 3.6 months (95% CI= 1.3 to 5.2) with last prior therapy (PMID: 33750196). In vitro studies of cancer cell lines that were treated with a farnesyl transferase inhibitor showed a decrease in RAS signaling and proliferation in the context of HRAS but not KRAS or NRAS mutation (PMID: 24240680). Additionally, in a genetically engineered mouse model of HRAS G12V mutation, treatment with a farnesyl transferase inhibitor-induced complete tumor regression in vivo (PMID: 24240680) (Abstract: Ho et al.
